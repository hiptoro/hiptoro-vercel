			<p>Caitlyn Jenner told Elon Musk that she is worried about his safety after &#8220;The Twitter Files&#8221; came out about the Hunter Biden laptop.</p>
<p>In a tweet on Friday, the ex-Olympian said:</p>
<blockquote><p>@elonmusk I hope you are surrounded by massive security and in an extremely safe undisclosed location &#8211; you just became public enemy number one to some very very bad people, I pray for your safety and thank you for your bravery! We need more @elonmusk in our society!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>Musk, the new owner of Twitter, also said that he probably should &#8220;increase his security&#8221; during a live interview on Twitter Space on Saturday. One speaker asked him if he was feeling any pressure since he released documents about Twitter&#8217;s decision to censor a 2020 New York Post story about a laptop linked to President Biden&#8217;s son Hunter.</p>
<p>The billionaire, who bought the social media site on October 27, said that he was trying to build trust by letting people see the internal documents. It&#8217;s not clear if Musk gave them to independent journalist Matt Taibbi, but he got them and posted internal communications and other information about the company&#8217;s decisions at the time.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what Musk said in a Tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Twitter acting by itself to suppress free speech is not a 1st amendment violation, but acting under orders from the government to suppress free speech, with no judicial review, is.</p></blockquote>
<p>An insider is reportedly said to have reached out to Musk for his comment.</p>
