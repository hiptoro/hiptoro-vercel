			<p>If you are a dog owner and you are working from home, you will absolutely relate to this. Pets are an absolute comfort during this pandemic. But this little guy got too comfortable.</p>
<p>But this is an absolutely hilariously-adorable incident when this Fox New’s professional news anchor is interrupted by his dog. He was rather cutely interrupted by his dog, during his live weather forecast.</p>
<h3>Brody is a television sensation-</h3>
<p>The famous golden retriever is named a Brody. He was witnessed by a lot while he was busy climbing on this News reporter’s lap. Brody was absolutely unaware.  The live forecast was still streaming on the television.</p>

He received lots of love from the viewers.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The reporter was embarrassed and immediately apologized for Brody’s interruption. But, we know how it is. Its okay Paul.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just like us, the news anchor on the other side, said, “This is amazing. I love it. We don’t need to see that forecast map; we’ll just look at Brody.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Other people online responded very well to this little cameo. In fact, people want more of Brody. They were more than delighted.</p>
<h3>This is how people responded to Brody&#8217;s little cameo-</h3>

<h3>Dogs make everything better</h3>
<p>To sum up, we live in a world where these little furry creatures make everything a little better. And dogs like Brody are only helping us in this quarantine.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the video:</p>

<p>Whether it’s a video-call office meeting or a quick chat with a friend, your dogs are always around.</p>
