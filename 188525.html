<figure id="attachment_188527" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188527" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-188527 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="569" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-2.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-2-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-188527" class="wp-caption-text">The adorable cat went missing years ago, right before Robert was planning on moving from California to Ohio. The devastated owner decided to ditch his plans and stayed in California for the whole year looking for his missing pal. “I remember at one point I was praying and I said, ‘God, I’ll do anything, just bring my Chebon back,’” Robert said in a video posted on the Ventura County Animal Services. The cat seemed to have disappeared forever and Robert had no other choice than to move on. Then 7 years later, a woman spotted a cat who looked ill, so she decided to catch the animal and take him to the vet. Luckily, the cat she found had a microchip, and in an instant, they knew who is the owner of the 19-year-old cat who had been living in the streets for years. That’s when Robert received a call saying that his cat was alive. After finally seeing the cat, Robert immediately recognized his buddy and burst into tears. After all these years, the two friends were back together. The touching moment was captured by the animal shelter and instantly went viral, leaving so many people in tears.</figcaption></figure>

One of the residents brought him in after he was injured and wanted to get him fixed and look after him. As much as I wanted T shirt back, the guy and the cat have been together for so long so I agreed with his request to let him own the cat&#8230; with visits allowed lol.

He’s wasn’t a big eater before, but he always had to eat very quickly before his brothers stole it. He was probably glad he didn’t have to compete with them to eat for once. He has a huge appetite now though. I’ve had to leave him with a big bucket of food; he just won’t stop eating. We’re not going to put him on a diet though, he’s just a bit rounder, but he’s a perfect cat picture.&#8221;</figcaption></figure>
