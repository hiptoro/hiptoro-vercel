			<p>You must have noticed or experinced yourself that it takes a lot of patinece to train an animal to behave in a certain way. If you have a cat, dog or any other animal in your house, you have to observe them carefully to understand what thing to they accept and reject. The constant process of trying and keeping patience to make them do a task is not easy at all. But if you continue to train them, they will finally adapt to changes that you wnat them to accept.</p>
<p>e&#8217;re all unknowingly training our pets all day long,&#8221; Samantha Bell, cat expert for Best Friends Animal Society, told Hiptoro. &#8220;Every time we interact with them, we&#8217;re training them. The reason for this unintentional training is &#8216;operant conditioning&#8217; &#8211; behavior leads to a reward which leads to a repeat of the behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m a cat behavior expert. It happens to the best of us,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>A redditor u/shoonpo submitted a question to r/AskReddit: &#8220;What have you accidentally conditioned your pet to do?&#8221; He wanted to get to know more about the phenominan.  As of this article, the post has nearly 64,000 upvotes and 13,000 comments, many of which are fun stories like Samantha&#8217;s!</p>

If he&#8217;s awake, he&#8217;s talking. I think it&#8217;s adorable but it drives my husband nuts, which has resulted in my husband yelling at him a lot (don&#8217;t worry, the cat doesn&#8217;t get upset). Now the cat thinks that&#8217;s just how my husband talks, so whenever he sees him he yells at him really loudly in order to imitate him. My husband will walk in the room and my cat will stop whatever he&#8217;s doing and just meow SO LOUDLY right in his face. It&#8217;s absolutely hilarious, dude got exactly what he deserved.</figcaption></figure>

<figure id="attachment_130404" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-130404" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-130404 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-173.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="717" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-173.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-173-293x300.jpg 293w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-130404" class="wp-caption-text">I take baths with my cat by letting her float in a plastic box. I keep the box in my closet. I only started doing this about a month ago, but now when I turn the bathwater on she runs to the closet and jumps in her box.</figcaption></figure>
<p>According to Bell, any reward-motivated animal is the easiest to train, including dogs, cats, chickens, and even fish. &#8220;Their species doesn&#8217;t matter as much as you&#8217;d think when it comes to training! The more they want treats or pets or attention or a certain toy, the easier they are to train. My two cats that are obsessed with treats are so easy to train that I can teach them a new behavior in a couple of 5-minute sessions. But my cat that is &#8216;meh&#8217; about treats takes more time, work, and patience. Helpful training tip: I reserve treats for training time only. When they hear the treat bag crinkle, they know that they’re in training mode and are ready to learn. This gives more value to the reward which also helps with training.&#8221;</p>

He somehow figured out it&#8217;s my favorite thing to do when ever he comes over to me. So now, everytime he senses that I&#8217;m upset or sees that I&#8217;m crying, he would come up to me and gently put his snout in my hand.</figcaption></figure>
<p>However, he also mentioned that some pets are just not that motivated and are difficult to train. &#8220;If you have a pet that does not seem to get excited about anything: attention, treats, food, pets, toys, you should have them checked out by your vet to make sure they&#8217;re feeling ok.&#8221;</p>

Now we just say &#8220;all the puppies&#8221; and he goes downstairs and into his kennel. If we forget, he puts himself to bed. 🙂 My dad works from home and will take a break to let the animals out into the backyard. He says &#8220;time for recess!&#8221; And they all come running, cats included! Last but not least, when my dad plays the piano, the dog sits next to him and &#8220;sings&#8221;. It&#8217;s the world&#8217;s most obnoxious bark/yowl combo. My dad has a way with animals.</figcaption></figure>

So, whenever the bird was tired, it would make that noise, because that meant it was time to sleep. It mimicked it so perfectly that I found myself checking my phone whenever it was naptime for the birdy. I miss you Pistachio!</figcaption></figure>

He looks at me expectantly. After a few times like this I realized he learned that looking around intensely at stuff means treats, love and attention. It’s now been 4 years and he will still look at me then pointedly look around the apartment, then back at me, expecting a reward. Has it resulted in him spotting the occasional bug? Yes, especially since over the years I’ve learned the slight difference between his real expression and the fake “I want treats” one. Still, even if I know it’s all a lie, it throws me off and sometimes I give in and look anyway. Maybe I’m imagining it but he always looks so satisfied afterwards, the fluffy jerk.</figcaption></figure>

I know he pretty much only gets a decent sleep that way, so every time he&#8217;s laying down I cover him with one. So whenever he wants to have a nap, or it&#8217;s time to go to sleep at night, he jumps up onto the couch, or bed, or really wherever I am, and just sits there starring at me, until I grab a blanket and drape it over top of him &#8211; to which he then lays down and falls asleep. The funny part is that he&#8217;ll often sit there in that position waiting for minutes on end. Sometimes he&#8217;s not even facing me when he does it which is the funniest. He&#8217;ll get up on the bed, put his ass in my face, sit, and just wait. He knows he doesn&#8217;t even feign loving me to get what he wants, he just knows it&#8217;s going to happen so why put up a facade? He&#8217;s become very entitled about it. 2) Whenever I bring my dogs in from a walk or from the back yard, I give them a treat, which I keep in the kitchen. So whenever we come in, they run to the kitchen and get in the sitting position (&#8216;sit&#8217; is always the first command in a string of commands that I use when giving them treats). If I forget, they&#8217;ll sit there for however long it takes for me to circle back around and give them a treat &#8211; sometimes this takes 5-10 minutes if I&#8217;m distracted; but they&#8217;ll just sit there waiting. They have trained me well.</figcaption></figure>
