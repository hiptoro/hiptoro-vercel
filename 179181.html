			<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Animals can’t think like humans,  neither they can talk to us in our language.  They only need love and that is what ties us together.

<p>The owner has shared a picture of the new little gem she adopted. I urge you to pause for a moment and look at how peacefully she is sleeping.
