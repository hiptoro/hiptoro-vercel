			25+ Adoption Photos of Animals Show How They Can't Keep Their Joy
		  </h1>
			
			<h4>When animals find their forever homes, they find eternal happiness.</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m baffled as to why people abandon their pets. Who has that sort of courage? Not me. Fortunately, these stray animals eventually find their way to various animal shelters. I am so grateful that these shelters exist; otherwise, I can&#8217;t imagine what the future would hold for all of these abandoned animals. Do you think it&#8217;s safe for a tiny 5-week-old puppy to walk down the streets on its own? Certainly not. Rescuers arrive and transport the animals to shelters for rehabilitation.</p>
<p>However, the plan is not to keep them in those shelters indefinitely. Nobody enjoys seeing a cute animal in a kennel. No animal deserves to be confined in a cage. They are very similar to us and deserve the same level of liberty that we do. They&#8217;re supposed to run around parks, fetch things, get belly rubs, and be spoiled. These animals are then adopted by animal shelters in the hope that they will soon find their happy forever homes.</p>
<p>Here are some before and after pictures of adopted animals. And, to be honest, their reactions are so adorable and heartwarming that some of the comparisons may make you cry. Are you ready for a big dose of joy? Coming right your way.</p>
<h4>1. A flawless transformation. What a cutie!<br />

<p>12. Piper was adopted by a caring family who also taught him how to look after his owner, who suffered from a chronic condition. Serving important purposes are both dogs and people.<br />

<p>13. Judging from the image on the right, Goku appears to be living life to the fullest after three years at his forever home. Go Super Saiyan on em’ cute boi.<br />

<p>My ideal and perfect world would be one in which there are no animal shelters. Yeah, I realise it sounds strange to say that about groups that help animals find new homes, but bear with me.</p>
<p>Consider what would happen if no one abandoned their pets. Imagine a world where humans exclusively express unconditional love and affection to their pets. There would be no abandoned pets, no stray animals, and no need for rescue teams to care for such creatures. A touching story about pets who spend their entire lives with their owners. But, considering how reality is, I recognise this is a pretty impractical thought. But I just have good intentions for these animals.</p>

14. Patience results in unbreakable relationships! Before he was 10 months old, this boy had to go to three different shelters. But his home eventually came to him.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-207018" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="726" height="726" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14-100x100.jpg 100w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/14.jpg 728w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></p>
<p>15. No smiling behind bars; big huge smiles when released.<br />
