<p>Giuliano Dore, the co-founder of &#8216;Get Groomed,&#8217; and his team explained to Hiptoro how to keep long hair healthy and the best way for men to take care of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a number of male customers with longer hair who are looking for advice from us about how to keep their hair healthy,&#8221; Giuliano said. According to &#8216;Get Groomed&#8217;s&#8217; barbers, cutting the ends of your hair just a tad from time to time keeps your hair healthy.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no shame in taking care of your hair with different oils like argan oil, castor oil, etc. do not over-wash your hair, use hair bands that don’t pull at the root,&#8221; the &#8216;Get Groomed&#8217; team shared.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, few men are of this opinion that taking care of long hair is not very masculine. &#8220;While most women know the tips and have been maintaining long hair for a long time, men do not necessarily talk about hair maintenance. They just don’t know and some men still believe that hair maintenance is not &#8216;manly&#8217; and suffer from hair loss. This self-harm needs to stop!&#8221;</p>
