			<p>Human beings are not perfect. Sometimes we have a hard time letting go of the things we don&#8217;t like.</p>
<p>Sometimes we judge people if we&#8217;re being honest with ourselves. People are sharing what it is that they tend to judge others for.</p>

<p>Why is it that the calls turn into screaming matches? I don&#8217;t understand it. Isn&#8217;t that what earbuds are for? The more personal the phone call, the louder it is.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve all been able to see a movie in a theater, so it&#8217;s a good time to review some simple guidelines. The phone goes off when the lights go out. It&#8217;s as simple as that.</p>

<p>I think we can come to a collective agreement that there is no excuse for littering in 2021. It goes double for all you car-smokers out there. I want to scream when I see a lit butt fly out the window.</p>

<p>tipping culture in North America has gotten out of hand and I will be the first to admit it. You never stiff a server. You don&#8217;t have to tip 20%, but you have to leave 15%.</p>

<p>I am a part of this crowd.</p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t you like cats or dogs if you&#8217;re allergic or attacked? It seems a little <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5et35b/what_are_reasons_you_silently_judge_people_for/dag7r9p/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">odd</a>.</p>

<p>I feel like this is something that not everyone can control, but a lot of people secretly judge other people for it.</p>
<p>Do it quietly, and make sure you&#8217;re chewing with your mouth closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Parking in front of the doors or at the front curb of the shopping center, grocery store, etc. That is a fire lane, not a sloth&#8217;s parking area. The walk from 20 feet away won&#8217;t kill you. For those who genuinely need it, there are handicapped spaces!&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5et35b/what_are_reasons_you_silently_judge_people_for/dag8xqn/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">u/dead_in_the-boot</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Having no art on their walls, or having bad art on their walls. I even peek into peoples&#8217; homes when I walk around my neighborhood, just to see what they have on the wall. I&#8217;m an art teacher and exhibiting photographer.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5et35b/what_are_reasons_you_silently_judge_people_for/dag9066/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">u/mikeymikeymikey1968</a></p>

<p>When you were a teenager, you definitely talked behind someone&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t use your indicators to show who is behind you or next to you that you want to change lanes, you&#8217;re being judged by a lot of users.</p>

<p>&#8220;People who pay with cash and once the transaction is complete, take their time and don&#8217;t move out of the way while putting their change back into their purse/wallet. At least move to the side.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5et35b/what_are_reasons_you_silently_judge_people_for/dag9ngz/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">u/xtyxtbx</a></p>

<p>&#8220;People who insist on checking in on FB when they are at the hospital or at a doctors surgery, or writing a status complaining about how they have been waiting at the doctor&#8217;s surgery, and then evade answering when someone finally gives them what they want and asks &#8216;whats wrong&#8217;.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5et35b/what_are_reasons_you_silently_judge_people_for/daga80l/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">u/yeezus-101</a></p>

<p>&#8220;My fiance has this friend who always, always smells bad. Like a mix of BO and mildew. I know he bathes cause he never has greasy hair or anything, he just always stinks for some reason. He&#8217;s a nice guy but I dislike him for this reason alone.&#8221; &#8211; u/deleted</p>

<p>&#8220;Deadbeat parents that refuse to take responsibility for taking care of their children. My uncle&#8217;s wife had to take my uncle to court for child support and they are MARRIED.

<p>I can definitely relate to this one.</p>
<p>Unsolicited nutrition or fitness advice from people who aren&#8217;t trained professionals is something that gets under my skin.</p>
