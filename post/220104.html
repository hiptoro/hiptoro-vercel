			<p>Stephen &#8220;tWitch&#8221; Boss, a TV star, died this week at the age of 40. A coroner has now found out what killed him.</p>
<p>Boss was best known for his time on The Ellen Show, which lasted from 2014 until the show was canceled in 2022.</p>
<p>He was also a professional dancer, an actor, and a social media personality who was best known for spreading good vibes online.</p>
<p>After news came out that he had been found dead in a Los Angeles hotel, his wife, Allison Holker, confirmed on Wednesday that he had died suddenly.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=220111" rel="attachment wp-att-220111"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-220111" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2M0EYWF-860x1024-1.jpg" alt="" width="702" height="836" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2M0EYWF-860x1024-1.jpg 702w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2M0EYWF-860x1024-1-252x300.jpg 252w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></a></p>
<p>Holker told a source that she was telling them the news with the &#8220;heaviest of hearts&#8221; just days after they celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is with the heaviest of hearts that I have to share my husband Stephen has left us,</p></blockquote>
<p>the 34-year-old said.</p>
<blockquote><p>Stephen lit up every room he stepped into. He valued family, friends and community above all else and leading with love and light was everything to him. He was the backbone of our family, the best husband and father, and an inspiration to his fans.</p></blockquote>
<p>She continued,</p>
<blockquote><p>To say he left a legacy would be an understatement, and his positive impact will continue to be felt.</p>
<p>I am certain there won&#8217;t be a day that goes by that we won&#8217;t honor his memory. We ask for privacy during this difficult time for myself and especially for our three children.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Stephen, we love you, we miss you, and I will always save the last dance for you,</p></blockquote>
<p>Allison concluded the emotional statement.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Ellen DeGeneres also remembered her longtime friend and fellow cast member.</p>

<p>She showed her followers a picture of the two of them hugging on set and wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Iâ€™m heartbroken. tWitch was pure love and light.</p>
<p>He was my family, and I loved him with all my heart. I will miss him. Please send your love and support to Allison and his beautiful children &#8211; Weslie, Maddox, and Zaia.</p></blockquote>
<p>At first, it was thought that Boss had killed himself, which was later confirmed by the coroner.</p>
<p>In a separate statement to the source, county officials confirmed that the 40-year-old dancer killed himself by shooting himself in the head at a motel in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Encino.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner says that the case is now over.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=220109" rel="attachment wp-att-220109"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-220109" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2KB7C7W-1024x683-1.jpg" alt="" width="702" height="468" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2KB7C7W-1024x683-1.jpg 702w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2KB7C7W-1024x683-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></a></p>
<p>Boss&#8217;s children, Weslie, 14, Maddox, 6, and Zaia, 3, and his wife are the ones who he is survived by.</p>
<p>During this very hard time, his family and friends are in our thoughts and prayers.</p>
