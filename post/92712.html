			<p>Ava &#8211; a golden chow mix has given birth to 7 puppies. To a surprise, the owner realized that the dog mother has delivered eight more adorable puppies. The owner &#8211; Ashlee Holland always felt passionate about the animal but this time she was baffled.</p>
<p>Ashlee Holland recently adopted Ava and soon build a special bond with the pregnant dog as she herself is a mother.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s kind of always been a passion I’ve had. I’ve always wanted to rescue, I’ve always wanted to work in the veterinary field. It’s instinct,&#8221; she said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since Ava had been placed on the euthanasia list at a local shelter, Ashlee knew she was the poor dog’s last resort. She said in an interview with FOX4 &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>“No dog deserves to be put to sleep for space.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ashlee knew Ava was pregnant from the start. But the X-rays of Ava never showed up that how many puppies she was actually carrying in her womb.</p>
<h3>A litter of Puppies</h3>
<p>In no less than two weeks when Ava was brought to her new home, she went into labor. It was Sunday. Ashlee was bewildered but was little tensed about the mother dog&#8217;s health. Ashlee says &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>“First puppy came out at 10:02. She then popped up four more within 57 minutes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The baffled owner further explained calmy &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;She had two more in the next hour and a half or so.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ashlee waited and thought that the new mommy was done. So, she properly cleaned Ava off and wiped the baby dogs. She then kept them safe and went to bed.</p>

<p>When Ashlee woke up the next morning, she learned a jaw-dropping surprise &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There were eight more puppies. Got my kids ready for school, there are now three more puppies&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Ava gave birth to 18 healthy puppies.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s heaven. Puppy pile, you can’t get any better than that,&#8221; Holland said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ashlee said her nine-year-old son, a huge Kansas City Royals fan, named all of the pups after a few well-known faces. &#8220;We got Ned Yost, Dayton Moore, Buck O&#8217;Neil. We got Esky, Royal,&#8221; she said. she continues &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s overwhelming. It’s incredible. I didn’t just save one life, I saved 19. It’s amazing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The puppies will be ready for adoption once the pending examination gets completed.</p>
