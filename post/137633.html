			Dog Owner Built An Amazing Room For His Special Rescue Doggo &amp; It’s Pawsome

			<h2>This space might just be better than most human bedrooms.</h2>
<p>We have seen many people building a room for their dogs that has massive space and comfort. But this special dog room is better than all others. A room under the stairs just like the Harry Potter rooms in the movie.</p>
<p>Buster&#8217;s owner built him this room for the dog to feel safe. He is a rescue dogs and therefore to make him feel loved and special, this was a sweet gesture by his parent to give him the best life.</p>
<h2>This is the special rescue doggo named Buster.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137636 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-191.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-191.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-191-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Buster is my 12-year-old rescue Staffordshire Bull Terrier. I’ve had him just over 2 years. He’s not had the best life and that changed the day I met him.</p>
<p>Initially, I was only supposed to foster him but I fell in love, and we both knew we were meant to be together.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137637 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-189.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-189.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-189-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>Due to his past, he hates being around single men.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137638 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-183.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="935" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-183.jpg 525w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-183-168x300.jpg 168w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Due to bad experiences in his life he doesn’t like to be around single men and when we’re alone at home he stays on his own in the bedroom.</p>
<p>He will only come down when other people are here as well. Or for walks and food.</p></blockquote>
<h2>However, he is slowly getting past his trauma.</h2>
<blockquote><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137639 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-187.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="777" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-187.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-187-270x300.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>We’ve been working really, really hard on his trust issues. And because his behavior has improved so much, he is now a therapy dog and we visit residential homes hospitals and a brain injury rehabilitation clinic.</p>
<p>He also accompanies people with low social skills, autism, agoraphobia, etc out shopping.</p></blockquote>
<h2>That is one of the reasons why Sean wanted to build Buster a safe place.</h2>
<blockquote><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137640 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-178.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-178.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-178-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The boudoir was an idea to give Buster a cozy space of his own in the same room as me. To really let him know he can be safe around me and feel secure in his little den at the same time.</p>
<p>After finishing it, he went in there almost instantly. It has been a few weeks now and he’s happy to sleep and hang out in his house.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The total spent on the place came to about $130 but it was worth it.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137641 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-177.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-177.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-177-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>As it was in my own living room, I wanted it to blend in and look part of the room.</p>
<p>I had no real plan, I just bought some wood and plyboard, and just did it as I went along.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Slowly but surely, the place started to come together.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137645 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/8-177.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/8-177.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/8-177-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>There is even a story behind the quote on the front.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137647 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9-166.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9-166.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9-166-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>‘Imagine being a monkey’</strong> on the front is the first line from a lullaby I sing to him when he’s having bad dreams.</p></blockquote>
<h2>And this is the amazing end result of all the hard work.</h2>
<blockquote><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137649 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10-167.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10-167.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10-167-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of the cosmetic finishes, like the TV and shelf and mood lighting, were really just a bit of fun, but the cooling fan works really well. It’s all battery run so no electrics are in there.</p>
<p>The items were just lying around the house.</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137651 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11-163.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11-163.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11-163-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>Sean also decided to add photos of his previous dog Zook.</h2>
<blockquote><p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-137653 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12-155.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12-155.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12-155-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>This is Zook, the reason Buster found a home in the first place.</h2>

<p>From start to finish, the boudoir took me about four days to make. After I painted it and used carpet adhesive, Buster wasn’t allowed in for another two weeks.</p>
<p>I’ll never fuss or play with him when he’s in there as I want him to feel it’s his own little corner. But if he wanders on to my turf he’s in tug of war hell.</p>

<p>We hope that this story makes you believe that they are not such violent dogs.</p>

<blockquote><p>.I’m absolutely blown away by the response it had from hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world.</p>
<p>Staffordshire Bull Terriers are getting very bad press and it’s so lovely to be able to show them that they are beautiful dogs that deserve a wonderful life</p></blockquote>
