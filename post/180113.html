			<p>Not everyone can make true friends. But it seems like one group of babies in Southern California have built-in best friends. Confused? Well, nine employees of the Rancho Cucamonga Fire District had babies at pretty much the same time. They had a total of seven girls and two boys.</p>
<p>“Say hello to Rancho Cucamonga Fire’s newest little family members! Between March and July of this year, nine <a href="https://tiphero.com/21-parents-share-photos-of-their-babies-who-were-born-with-full-heads-of-hair">babies were born</a> in the department and we couldn’t pass up the opportunity to capture this special moment,” the fire department wrote on Facebook. “We are thrilled to see our RCFD fire family keep growing!”</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a normal thing that happens usually. So, when the news broke out, it became a headline. Before you ask, this sweet miracle was not planned in any way. It&#8217;s a complete coincidence.</p>
<p>“I remember when we found out there was, like, six, and then it was like, oh no, wait there’s seven, no there’s eight, then when we found out about the ninth, we were just like, ‘I can’t believe it,&#8217;” said one member.</p>
<p>They have even done a firefighter-themed photo shoot to commemorate the occasion.</p>

<p>“It’s brought everyone closer together, not just the nine firefighters, but also the wives,” said Gabrielle Costello, who posted the pictures that went viral. “We share tips and sleep schedules and all that kind of new mom stuff.”</p>
<p>“Our husbands work 24-hour shifts. During fire season they are gone for weeks on end,” she added. “It’s nice to have friends that understand the firefighter lifestyle.”</p>
<p>See the below video to meet the nine proud dads with their adorable babies.</p>
