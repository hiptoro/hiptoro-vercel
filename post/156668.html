I&#8217;m an RN and worked with FAR too many people in the healthcare field as a whole (not just other nurses, but also lab workers, RT&#8217;s, pharmacists, hell even some MD&#8217;s) who think/thought COVID was a hoax or &#8220;greatly exaggerated&#8221; and are now refusing the new vaccine, even though we all KNOW how mRNA and vaccines work. Plenty of anti-maskers too. It&#8217;s like they just used their degrees as tissue paper or something, I seriously don&#8217;t get how you can learn what we learn, understand it well enough to practice in the field, and yet still allow political stances to override all that, it&#8217;s freaking ridiculous.</p>

My high school biology teacher was a super religious creationist. He taught us about evolution while telling us how he thought it was all bulls**t. I always wondered why people go into professions that are directly opposed to their beliefs. Seems like a miserable existence.</p>

I’m an ICU nurse of about 10 years. I would occasionally float to our regular, non-ICU, and non-covid floors. Plenty of nurses denied how serious covid was.</p>
<p>The cognitive dissonance is real. Of course, none of them came up to help on our covid units</p>

Used to be a science teacher and I always got flack on the evolution chapter from parents that were doctors. Like babe I hope you at least believe in bacteria and viruses evolving&#8230;</p>

Degree is Psychology here. So many peers with devout faith, one brain dead moron took psychology as a way “to know god better” he told me and convert more to Jesus.</p>
<p>Once took a course literally called, “Belief in Weird Things” which was for Psych majors. 300 students enrolled, nearly half dropped out because they were offended at some point when we broke down their weird beliefs.</p>

Professional cook here. Near the beginning of the pandemic I heard about a Sous Chef I worked with in the past being an anti-masker. I asked through the grapevine why he washes his hands before and after handling food and the reply was “that’s common sense”. But somehow the scientific medical community saying that masks help prevent illnesses is just a big hoax. It’s beyond frustrating.</p>

I worked with a former airline PILOT who was/is a flat earther. He has since gone back to being a pilot but I am not sure if he still thinks Earth is flat. When I pressed him on being a former pilot and believing malarkey he claimed the school&#8217;s indoctrination into round earth didn’t work on him and that the pilot&#8217;s windscreen was a very thick and curved glass that made everything appear to be curved.</p>

My mom is a geologist and she worked with someone who was a young-earth creationist. That person&#8217;s excuse was &#8220;god created rocks that were 4.6 billion years old&#8221;. I guess if it works it works, but that makes no sense to me</p>

I&#8217;ve met a PhD in Chemistry from a top 5 university that was anti-vax. Their PhD work actually involved the analysis of heavy metals in an environment and how it impacted a childs likelihood to develop autism. I got into it with them, and they were able to reference a handful of scholarly papers to justify their stance.</p>
