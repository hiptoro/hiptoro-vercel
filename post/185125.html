			<p>Ask the celebs if acting isn&#8217;t cut out for them.</p>
<p>All of them had successful careers, along with all the perks that come with that. Fame, fortune, fans, you name it.</p>
<p>They all made a choice. Either take a break or retire permanently.</p>
<p>Come see what the celebs chose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Selena Gomez.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185130" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HxfTB4730zjmmxcxqz1S.png" alt="" width="768" height="577" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HxfTB4730zjmmxcxqz1S.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/HxfTB4730zjmmxcxqz1S-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>The actress takes a lot of breaks for her health.</p>
<p>She set the record straight when she was accused of going to rehab. &#8220;I was diagnosed with Lupus, and I&#8217;ve been through chemotherapy. That&#8217;s what my break was really about. I could&#8217;ve had a stroke,&#8221; she <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6721973/selena-gomez-billboard-cover-sneak-peek?utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> <em>Billboard</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Chris Hemsworth.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185131" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1kOxilScHiRGYik5Xbuh.png" alt="" width="1024" height="770" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1kOxilScHiRGYik5Xbuh.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1kOxilScHiRGYik5Xbuh-300x226.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1kOxilScHiRGYik5Xbuh-768x578.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>While his wife retired from Hollywood, the actor took a break.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t want to leave his kids for a year while they were young.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Jessica Alba.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185132" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ysCe2vMizTz9Xat73QDq.png" alt="" width="1024" height="771" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ysCe2vMizTz9Xat73QDq.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ysCe2vMizTz9Xat73QDq-300x226.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ysCe2vMizTz9Xat73QDq-768x578.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>She played the queen of the 2000s in Blue Crush, Dark Angel, and Fantastic Four.</p>
<p>She is now a wife, mother, and businesswoman and has changed her perspective on film.</p>
<h2>Alba told Good Housekeeping that she wouldn&#8217;t return to the screen unless she had total control.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-185133" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/wrCquKHaRzZgoET9C4M5.gif" alt="" width="603" height="455" /></p>
<p>“If I could develop a film or a series for Netflix, that would be cool. I still have my Dark Angel fans, and Hollywood is finally allowing women to star more in action franchises, which is a passion of mine,&#8221; she <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a47080/jessica-alba-honest-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Eddie Murphy.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-185134" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Celebrities-Who-Needed-To-Take-A-Break-Or-Retire-Completely-From-Acting.gif" alt="" width="681" height="380" /></p>
<p>The comedian took a break from making bad movies after he won the worst actor of the decade award.</p>
<p>He has a few roles, including the Coming 2 America sequel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Michael J. Fox.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185135" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MvUmJhQHws0CXVGCUwVd.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="684" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MvUmJhQHws0CXVGCUwVd.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MvUmJhQHws0CXVGCUwVd-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MvUmJhQHws0CXVGCUwVd-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>During his career, the actor has announced two retirements.</p>
<p>In 2020, he wrote in his book, &#8220;There is a time for everything, and my time of putting in a twelve-hour workday, and memorizing seven pages of dialogue, is best behind me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. Joe Pesci.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-185137" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Celebrities-Who-Needed-To-Take-A-Break-Or-Retire-Completely-From-Acting_2.gif" alt="" width="689" height="373" /></p>
<p>If anyone could bring the actor out of retirement, it was Martin Scorsese.</p>
<p>He played a lead role in The Irishman, which was nominated for an Oscar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. Mara Wilson.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185138" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NG1FJPGR27YbCjaCjtFx.png" alt="" width="1024" height="770" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NG1FJPGR27YbCjaCjtFx.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NG1FJPGR27YbCjaCjtFx-300x226.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NG1FJPGR27YbCjaCjtFx-768x578.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>After starring as a child in Mrs. Wilson was one of the most beloved child actors in Hollywood.</p>
<p>According to People, she quit as a child star due to the pressures of Hollywood.</p>
<p class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">&#8220;I realized, ‘I don’t fit their idea of what a Hollywood actress looks like, so there’s no room for me here.’ It’s hard to come out of that sane and without some serious doubts about yourself.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-185139" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Celebrities-Who-Needed-To-Take-A-Break-Or-Retire-Completely-From-Acting_3.gif" alt="" width="729" height="310" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>8. Jack Gleeson.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-185140" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Celebrities-Who-Needed-To-Take-A-Break-Or-Retire-Completely-From-Acting_4.gif" alt="" width="700" height="391" /></p>
<p>It was difficult for the actor to play one of the most hated characters in television history.</p>
<p>That was the role of Joffrey Baratheon, who died in the Purple Wedding episode of Game of Throne.</p>
<h2>He retired from acting at the age of 21.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185141" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-361.png" alt="" width="638" height="894" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-361.png 638w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-361-214x300.png 214w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I’ve been acting since age 8. I just stopped enjoying it as much as I used to,&#8221; he told <em><a href="https://ew.com/article/2014/04/13/jack-gleeson-joffrey-death/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a></em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you make a living from something, it changes your relationship with it. It’s not like I hate it, it’s just not what I want to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9. Matt Damon.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-185142" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/OXOmJ95o50ybpkcablTl.gif" alt="" width="672" height="339" /></p>
<p>He said enough was enough after the actor&#8217;s Hollywood career affected his family.</p>
<p>He told Today in 2016 that he&#8217;d done four movies in a row and dragged them all over the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>10. Daniel Day-Lewis.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-185143" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Celebrities-Who-Needed-To-Take-A-Break-Or-Retire-Completely-From-Acting_5.gif" alt="" width="627" height="332" /></p>
<p>He announced his retirement after Phantom Thread.</p>
<p>He called it &#8220;something I had to do,&#8221; telling <em><a href="https://variety.com/2017/film/news/daniel-day-lewis-retirement-from-acting-why-1202625443/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Variety</a></em>, &#8220;I need to believe in the value of what I’m doing. The work can seem vital. Irresistible, even. And if an audience believes it, that should be good enough for me. But, lately, it isn’t.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>11. Frankie Muniz.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185144" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2cwCLhPePvIYhG7pJQ5I.png" alt="" width="768" height="577" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2cwCLhPePvIYhG7pJQ5I.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2cwCLhPePvIYhG7pJQ5I-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>The actor was everywhere in the early 2000s. Malcolm in the Middle, Big Fat Liar, and Agent Banks are just a few.</p>
<p>He retired from the spotlight in 2006 to focus on his interests. He and his wife own an olive oil store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>12. Dave Chapelle.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185145" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bQ4aoAAJvpiYahZI3d6w.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="481" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bQ4aoAAJvpiYahZI3d6w.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bQ4aoAAJvpiYahZI3d6w-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The world was shocked when the comedian left Hollywood.</p>
<p>The fame got to him and his family. &#8220;That kind of attention wouldn&#8217;t have been conducive to raising a family,&#8221; he told <em><a href="https://people.com/celebrity/pal-says-its-over-for-dave-chappelle-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">People</a></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>13. Eva Mendes.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185146" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6HeIZvmn9VAx30xBnMMe.png" alt="" width="1024" height="770" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6HeIZvmn9VAx30xBnMMe.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6HeIZvmn9VAx30xBnMMe-300x226.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6HeIZvmn9VAx30xBnMMe-768x578.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>After having kids, the Hitch and Ghost Rider star took a break from Hollywood.</p>
<p>“I feel more ambitious in the home right now than I do in the workplace,&#8221; she told <em><a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a27116669/eva-mendes-ryan-gosling-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women&#8217;s Health</a></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>14. Ryan Gosling.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-185147" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Celebrities-Who-Needed-To-Take-A-Break-Or-Retire-Completely-From-Acting_6.gif" alt="" width="628" height="353" /></p>
<p>Ryan once took a step back from acting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost perspective on what I&#8217;m doing,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.today.com/news/ryan-gosling-announces-hes-taking-break-acting-1C8989279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in 2013. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s good for me to take a break and reassess why I&#8217;m doing it and how I&#8217;m doing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>15. Cameron Diaz.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185148" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6Ga1RKF1jvfGuM5I236C.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6Ga1RKF1jvfGuM5I236C.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6Ga1RKF1jvfGuM5I236C-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6Ga1RKF1jvfGuM5I236C-768x402.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>

<p>She retired in the summer of 2014 and said that she doesn&#8217;t miss performing. Diaz is busy with her first child with her husband.</p>
