			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are two types of people in this world. The first ones are those who are still not married and the second ones are those who are married. While unmarried people might feel like marriage is all about playing fun games, they don’t know that this game is not for the faint of heart! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can scroll down to get some idea about marriage so that you could know that it isn’t a joke. </span></p>
<h2><strong>1. Making compromises is a must</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135990 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-130.jpg" alt="" width="685" height="529" /></p>
<p>Any marriage is based on a string of compromises and we guess these newlyweds are aware of that.</p>
<h2><strong>2. This is not just a joke</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135991 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-130.jpg" alt="" width="543" height="624" /></p>
<p>We believe that this is actually a simple test to see how fast they lose their cool.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Here is how fights are restarted in an instant</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135992 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-124.jpg" alt="" width="527" height="641" /></p>
<p>Every argument between married couples is not really over until it bursts few more times.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Sometimes wanting to do something for your spouse is harder than expected</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135993 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-127.jpg" alt="" width="691" height="516" /></p>
<p>Men struggle with certain things their wives want them to pick up, and it seems this goes both ways.</p>
<h2><strong>5. This is a fine sense of humor</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135994 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-123.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="595" /></p>
<p>We find this funny, but we guess that some men might actually feel intimidated!</p>
<h2><strong>6. Marriage is putting all the cards down</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135995 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-9-1.jpg" alt="" width="485" height="626" /></p>
<p>We believe that when you are already married, you have the freedom to speak directly and sincerely.</p>
<h2><strong>7. Romance is a different thing in most marriages</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135997 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7-123.jpg" alt="" width="678" height="455" /></p>
<p>Romantic conversations and even intimate moments take a different turn in most marriages.</p>
<h2><strong>8. Well, we guess this is true</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136000 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/8-125.jpg" alt="" width="687" height="488" /></p>
<p>It is hard to argue with that! We all know that you can’t win a woman, she chooses you!</p>
<h2><strong>9. Here is a relatable image for all the moms out there</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136002 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9-117.jpg" alt="" width="530" height="625" /></p>
<p>It might be a bit exaggerated, but it is still true. Moms follow their duty 24/7 despite the cold.</p>
<h2><strong>10. Every fight ends with food</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136003 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10-119.jpg" alt="" width="680" height="539" /></p>
<p>The best way to bury the hatchet is to show love and care. Food is the best way to do it!</p>
<h2><strong>11. It is pointless to argue with a woman</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136006 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11-118.jpg" alt="" width="682" height="588" /></p>
<p>Married men know that they should never argue with their wives because they remember everything.</p>
<h2><strong>12. This is true in most cases</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136008 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12-112.jpg" alt="" width="634" height="620" /></p>
<p>If your wife tells you to do something in a certain way, you better listen because chances are she’s right.</p>
<h2><strong>13. Here is another relatable image</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136010 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/13-118.jpg" alt="" width="631" height="638" /></p>
<p>The situation described above happens all the time and it was illustrated perfectly with this image!</p>
<h2><strong>14. We guess that this is an excuse</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136012 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/14-114.jpg" alt="" width="411" height="538" /></p>
<p>Women often find it hard to keep a secret, so when they share it with their husbands, this is the excuse.</p>
<h2><strong>15. Here is how it goes</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136014 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/15-114.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1804" /></p>
<p>Students have absolutely no idea what life has in store for them and this collage pretty much sums it up!</p>
<h2><strong>16. Choose your words wisely</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136016 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16-108.jpg" alt="" width="684" height="511" /></p>
<p>Like we already mentioned, women seem to able to record every conversation you ever had with them!</p>
<h2><strong>17. Some men tend to brag about doing chores from time to time</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136018 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17-106.jpg" alt="" width="690" height="484" /></p>
<p>There is no need for bragging because most women do these things on a daily basis.</p>
<h2><strong>18. Now this is a facial expression many men have seen</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136020 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/18-100.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="604" /></p>
<p>We guess that there is no better way to explain these moments than this image. It speaks for itself.</p>
<h2><strong>19. Someone obviously tried to score</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136022 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/19-97.jpg" alt="" width="683" height="580" /></p>
<p>This is the result of game men like to play, but they are not NBA players and rarely win points.</p>
<h2><strong>20. Here is how it goes</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136023 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20-90.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="647" /></p>
<p>We might as well admit his, but married men need to ask their wives before going out with the guys.</p>
<h2><strong>21. There is no escaping from house chores when you are married</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136025 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/21-76.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="607" /></p>
<p>We guess that being married is somewhat comparable to an approaching tornado.</p>
<h2><strong>22. Here is some food for thought</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136027 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22-70.jpg" alt="" width="674" height="442" /></p>
<p>The funny caption of this image is actually funny because there is a lot of truth to it!</p>
<h2><strong>23. Some dads know only half of the struggle</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136029 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/23-68.jpg" alt="" width="606" height="607" /></p>
<p>We guess that only moms who are with their kids all the time know how tough it really is!</p>
<h2><strong>24. Women sometimes want to be dared to start a fight</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136031 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/24-66.jpg" alt="" width="605" height="611" /></p>
<p>It appears that men often fail to read the signs and this makes the tension even stronger.</p>
<h2><strong>25. Here is one man who has probably seen it all</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136033 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25-65.jpg" alt="" width="617" height="553" /></p>
<p>The long face and the blurry eyes are sure signs of a fight with the wife, no doubt about it.</p>
<h2><strong>26. If you can relate to these images, you are not alone</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136035 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26-64.jpg" alt="" width="472" height="639" /></p>
<p>As you can see, this collage perfectly sums up what it really feels like to argue when married.</p>
<h2><strong>27. This is one image that will make you chuckle</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-136037 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/27-60.jpg" alt="" width="686" height="508" /></p>
<p>Of course, the image was taken at the right moment and is a coincidence, but it is still e metaphor.</p>
