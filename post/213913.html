			<p>Recent discoveries aren&#8217;t as outlandish as previous ones&#8230; But it&#8217;s still fun to make one.</p>
<p>Discoveries do not come to you, so you must work hard to make one. They are difficult to find, which is why you feel such a sense of accomplishment and joy when you find something. And the best part is that no one else in the world knows about it until you finally tell them. In today&#8217;s world, making a breakthrough is very simple. You don&#8217;t have to contact a large scientific committee and go through all the nitty gritty; simply make a social media post, and that&#8217;s it. It only takes a few moments to become a certified discoverer. The only time spent is on the discovery; the rest is simple. Today&#8217;s discoveries aren&#8217;t like finding gold or oil.</p>
<p>They are distinct, and opinions may differ, but I find the newer, simpler discoveries to be far more interesting and amusing. We don&#8217;t want another oil reservoir discovery; we want heart-shaped oranges and clouds that form the shape of a horse; that&#8217;s the kind of discovery that will surprise everyone, and it&#8217;s not easy to make.</p>
<p>Today, we&#8217;ve compiled a list of 21 discoveries shared by their illustrious discoverers. They&#8217;re going to be really cool for you guys. Scroll down to have some fun!</p>

<p><strong>1. God knows how and where she discovered it, but this woman now possesses probably the largest hat in the world.</strong></p>
