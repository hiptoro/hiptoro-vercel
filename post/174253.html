			<p>Pets are often considered members of the family and love each other as much as human babies. But not everyone shares that feeling, and despite the fact that humans can form stronger bonds with pets than humans, we always believe that animals are less important than humans. ..<br />
Pets can&#8217;t speak, but they show love and never judge you, and others will find comfort in it. They will choose their pets over their loved ones when the need arises. And sometimes it comes. For Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/catwoesthrowaway/">catwoesthrowaway</a>, who shared the story that her boyfriend didn&#8217;t like her cat, one day she asked him to leave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>This woman tells a story of how her boyfriend who she lived with really didn&#8217;t like her cat, and one time she was really scared for her, so she asked the boyfriend to leave.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174255" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/22-bp-61795a37f09fc__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="810" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/22-bp-61795a37f09fc__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/22-bp-61795a37f09fc__700-259x300.jpg 259w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The Original Poster (OP) is a 24-year-old woman living with her older boyfriend at the time she told her story. Her boyfriend had moved in with her after considering it for a while. The woman has a cat named Millie and her boyfriend did not like her very much. In fact, he suggested that he should get rid of her because he doesn&#8217;t really like cats and he&#8217;s more of a dog person. At first, this attitude was not worrisome for the bride and she simply dismissed it. Also, he was willing to deal with it because the cat was very important to the woman.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174256" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-61795a3006ced__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="370" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-61795a3006ced__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-61795a3006ced__700-300x159.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>Even before they started living together, the boyfriend made it clear that he did not like cats, but the girlfriend did not take it seriously.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174257" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-61795a42ba74e__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="352" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-61795a42ba74e__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-61795a42ba74e__700-300x151.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>But there was an incident and the OP wanted to hear what the situation looks like from a passerby&#8217;s point of view. So what was the breaking point? It was the woman who overheard her boyfriend tell Millie, &#8220;You&#8217;re so f***ing useless.&#8221;</p>
<p>She described that there was so much malice in that tone and that the woman had never heard her boyfriend speak like this. She really freaked out. The woman told her boyfriend to get her out of her apartment, not caring that he had no other place to live.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174258" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-61795a442fee8__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="352" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-61795a442fee8__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-61795a442fee8__700-300x151.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>But when they started planning to live together, she found out that the boyfriend was not joking, but she would definitely not abandon her cat.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174259" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-61795a458480f__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="298" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-61795a458480f__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-61795a458480f__700-300x128.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The Redditor calmed down and that same day she spoke with her boyfriend. He explained that he felt bad by the way she said that her apartment was hers and not theirs. He was also sad on the fact that she chose an animal over a human. Regarding the way she had spoken to the cat before her, her boyfriend explained that he was just playing games and had misjudged her tone.</p>
<p>At the end of the story, catwoesthrowaway admitted that she felt bad about acting the way she did, but believes that her first instinct was correct, so now it is up to the reader to decide which side of the fence they stand on.</p>

<h2>The boyfriend was willing to deal with it, but one night, unaware that his girlfriend was around, he misbehaved with the cat.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174261" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-61795a48f3316__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="346" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-61795a48f3316__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-61795a48f3316__700-300x148.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve made up your mind, the story doesn&#8217;t really end here. The Redditor wrote an update post and we learned about the aftermath that night. The woman was relieved that the people in the comments had just confirmed what she had already thought of. She said, &#8220;That post validated all the fears that I had been dismissing as dramatic, and it was almost a relief that strangers encouraged me to do something that I had been too afraid to do before.&#8221;</p>
<h2>The OP was very freaked out because she never heard her boyfriend sound so malicious and demanded that he leave.</h2>

<p>It turns out that the couple broke up. The boyfriend had to leave because the apartment belonged to OP and it was not on the lease yet, so it was an easy process. It was easy logistically, but not emotionally when the woman opened up: “It was difficult to lose someone she trusted and thought she knew well, but based on her reaction I knew I had made the right decision. Basically, he told me that if I couldn&#8217;t learn to put other humans before my cat, I would be alone for a long time and that he would be waiting for me to come closer. &#8221;</p>
<h2>When they both calmed down and talked, the boyfriend expressed what was hurting him and the OP felt bad for acting the way she did.</h2>

<h2>But she still felt that her instincts were correct from the start even though she thinks she might have overreacted.</h2>

<p>Many people mentioned that the catwoesthroaway was gaslit and it was not the first time that she heard that from her boyfriend from someone else, because their sisters agreed with the opinion of the Internet. The OP added a photo of Millie and we put it at the beginning of the article so you can see the cuteness.</p>
<h2>The people in the comments were genuinely concerned about Millie and saw a lot of red flags, so they came to the conclusion that the OP did nothing wrong.</h2>
