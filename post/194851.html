<p>Not just innocent but this animal is also very common. <span style="font-weight: 400">I</span>f you <a href="https://www.theanimalclub.net/wildlife/man-builds-mini-picnic-table-so-his-back-yard-squirrels-can-dine-in-style/">look in your backyard</a> right now, you’ll probably find one.</p>
<p>But if you venture into the forests of India, you might just find a squirrel who will take your breath away.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some people went as far as to say they didn&#8217;t think this particular species </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">actually</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> existed because of the rarity of their colors. Otherwise known as the Malabar giant squirrel, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ratufa indica</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, are very much real — and quite adorable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are, also known as Shekru, are native to India. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Their unique fur can be found in different shades like brown and orange, and maroon and purple </span><a href="https://www.theanimalclub.net/wildlife/meet-the-white-browed-tit-warbler-the-bird-with-a-beautiful-rainbow-coloring/"><span style="font-weight: 400">colors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> are rarely found in mammals.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-194854 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-35.jpg" alt="" width="682" height="1023" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-35.jpg 682w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-35-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You might think that their conspicuous colors would be a drawback by making them stand out to predators, but in fact, it actually helps them survive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the shaded understory of a dense forest, the patchy colors and dark hues are a great adaptation to avoiding detection,” squirrel expert John Koprowski told </span><a href="https://www.thedodo.com/in-the-wild/indian-giant-squirrel-pictures"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Dodo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But when you see these in the sunlight, they show their ‘true colors’ and beautiful pelage.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-194855 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-35.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="555" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-35.jpg 1000w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-35-300x167.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-35-768x426.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only are they among the most colorful squirrels in the world, but they’re also some of the largest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For those more used to seeing the American grey squirrel or its far cuter cousin the Europen red, the Malabar is bound to come as a shock. For starters, as the name suggests, these cool animals are huge. Stretching as long as 3 feet &#8211; double the size of their standard gray relatives. They are much harder to miss than our own scurrilous buddies. Admittedly though, the brilliantly blue bushy tail accounts for much of the Malabar’s length. And also they&#8217;re capable of jumping up to 20 feet in the air between trees.</span></p>
<p>The Malabar isn’t too fussy about its diet and will eat what’s available up there in the treetops. Using their huge, bushy tails to swing around, they’ll search for flowers, bark, seeds, insects, and even bird eggs if there are any freely available. Just watch out for mother eagle, though!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While they’re amazing to look at, it might be a challenge to actually find one in the wild. They live in the forests of India, hopping from tree to tree and rarely touching the ground. They’re also known to be quite shy.</span></p>
<p>These four-pound tree dwellers, native to India, have an unusual method for storing their food that&#8217;s unlike any other squirrel.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their population is doing well, currently </span><a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/19378/22262028"><span style="font-weight: 400">listed on the IUCN Red List</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> as “least concern,” although deforestation could threaten them if unchecked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They have a wide distribution and seem to tolerate human presence and even some modest level of low-density housing,” he told The Dodo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re part of a group of squirrels that is pretty ancient. They’re a unique evolutionary group that’s been here a long time, which is a good thing.”</span></p>
