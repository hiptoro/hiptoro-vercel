			<p>Recreating your most beloved memory over the years is one of the greatest feelings. Meet high school grad Dylan Bliss and Ruger who recreates their memory of their childhood.</p>
<p>Dylan was young when his mother &#8211; Corie Bliss adopted the dog and brought it to their house in New Hampshire. No sooner the dog named Ruger became their family member. By then when they first met till today, both have been together on every phase of life.</p>
<p>Since to commemorate this incredible milestone &#8211; Colis wanted to recreate the childhood moment. That was taken on Dylan&#8217;s first day of his first grade. The family feels lucky that Roger has made it to Dylan&#8217;s grad ceremony. Dylan&#8217;s mom says &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We try to bring [Ruger] with us everywhere. He&#8217;s super loyal and loves his family.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Colie shared the moment through the Facebook post and added the heartfelt caption &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an absolute emotional basket case, so happy Ruger has pulled through long enough to make it for Dyl&#8217;s graduation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The side by side picture clearly depicts the inseparable bond between them. Since time flees but their bond throughout the journey is seen growing and seems forever.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I was looking at old pics, and came across Dylan&#8217;s first day of first grade pic with Ruger, when Ruger was a puppy,&#8221; Bliss said. &#8220;I wanted to recreate the picture the night of his high school graduation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="headline" style="text-align: center;"><strong>For Dylan, being able to pose with his best friend for both pictures and to have had him by his side for so long is a privilege he doesn&#8217;t take lightly</strong></h2>
<p>Colie was a bit emotional while sharing the moment captured perfectly, she says &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Lots of running mascara,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So many memories.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Despite being an older dog, he is now facing health challenges. Ruger is diagnosed with a terminal cancer. But Ruger is making memories still. Dylans speaks &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Having Ruger with me throughout school was great. No matter what grade I was in, I always have memories of coming home and getting greeted by Ruger at the door.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And I am sure the Ruger would be pretty proud of his best pal for graduating from high school.</p>
