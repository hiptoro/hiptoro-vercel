			<p>The TikTok influencer claims she spent $100,000 (AUD$159,000, PS 56,000) on a couch by mistake and isn&#8217;t handling the situation well.</p>
<p>On her TikTok account earlier in the day, Quenlin Blackwell posted a video of herself sobbing in her car.</p>
<p>She said that while she was driving, she had put her card information into an online auction for the couch.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old claimed that the auction was a joke and that when she entered her credit card number to make the purchase, she wasn&#8217;t being serious.</p>
<p>She was made to pay for the exorbitantly priced sofa in a swift act of karma, which set off a series of emotional events.</p>
<p>“I have to pull over right now because I’m about to f**king throw up,” she stated in the clip that has gone viral.</p>

<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-0-1" width="576" height="1026" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/TikTok-influencer-asks-followers-for-money-after-she-‘accidentally-bought-a-100000-couch.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/TikTok-influencer-asks-followers-for-money-after-she-‘accidentally-bought-a-100000-couch.mp4">https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/TikTok-influencer-asks-followers-for-money-after-she-‘accidentally-bought-a-100000-couch.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>“I just put an offer on a couch, and I was joking. I was joking, but I put in my card information, and it just charged my f**king account. I almost crashed my car when I saw it.”</p>
<p>Then she pleaded with her supporters to give her money so she could buy the pricey piece of furniture.</p>
<p>She cried: “If you have a million dollars, can you please donate? Can you please donate, please? If you have a million dollars, can you let me borrow some, please?”</p>
<p>6.5 million people have watched the video. &#8220;I can&#8217;t inhale&#8221; was the caption.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>People who watched the Blackwell video wrote comments asking why she put in her credit card information but didn&#8217;t buy the expensive piece of furniture.</p>
<p>One of the top comments was: “Girl, who puts in card info as a JOKE.”</p>
<p>A second one added: “ILY BUT WHY PUT YOUR INFO IN.”</p>
<p>She still won&#8217;t part with the furnishings on the sofa, despite some people&#8217;s interest in seeing the exorbitantly expensive sofa.</p>
<p>In a later video, she cried and told her fans that she had joined OnlyFans to try to make up for some of the money she had lost.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to, but I’m going to have to,” she said, adding she needed cash to pay for dental work as well as change the side mirror of her car.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to do a job. I’m about to throw up because I know they didn’t refund me.”</p>
<p>Many people are unsure whether the video is real or if OnlyFans is using it to try and get more subscribers.</p>
<p>When the TikTokker said she was a member of Diplo, she caused a similar stir on social media.</p>
<p>In a formal statement regarding the situation, the music producer stated: “OK so I rent one of my properties to Quenlin.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said: “Her social media is sarcastic and chaotic and I can see you can get a twisted idea but there is nothing but a friendship between us.”</p>
<p>This drama on the couch might just be another sarcastic remark.</p>
