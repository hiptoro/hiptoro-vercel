			<p>Stephen &#8220;tWitch&#8221; Boss died at age 40, and his wife paid tribute to him after hearing the news.</p>
<p>In a statement to a source, his wife Allison Holker Boss confirmed his tragic death just days after the couple celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary. She said she was telling the news with the &#8220;heaviest of hearts.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>It is with the heaviest of hearts that I have to share my husband Stephen has left us,</p></blockquote>
<p>the 34-year-old said.</p>
<blockquote><p>Stephen lit up every room he stepped into. He valued family, friends and community above all else and leading with love and light was everything to him. He was the backbone of our family, the best husband and father, and an inspiration to his fans.</p></blockquote>

<p>She continued,</p>
<blockquote><p>To say he left a legacy would be an understatement, and his positive impact will continue to be felt. I am certain there won&#8217;t be a day that goes by that we won&#8217;t honor his memory. We ask for privacy during this difficult time for myself and especially for our three children.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Stephen, we love you, we miss you, and I will always save the last dance for you,</p></blockquote>
<p>Allison concluded the emotional statement.</p>
<p>Sources said that the Ellen Show star had killed himself after being found in a Los Angeles hotel.</p>

<p>Police sources said that Boss&#8217;s wife, Allison Holker, ran to an LAPD station on Tuesday because she was worried about her husband.</p>
<p>Sources say she was &#8220;frantic&#8221; when she found out that he had left the house without his car, which was not like him.</p>

<p>Shortly after Holker&#8217;s report, police were called to a Los Angeles hotel where Boss was found dead from a gunshot wound that seemed to have been done by himself.</p>
<p>He and Holker, who had three kids together, had been married for nine years on Sunday. This was just a few days before he died in a terrible accident.</p>
<p>During this hard time, his family is in our thoughts and prayers.</p>
