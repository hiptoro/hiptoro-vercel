			<p>A young boy who gets nervous about flying was in tears after RyanAir&#8217;s computer system gave away his specially reserved window seat to someone else.</p>
<p>Ryan Bandli was upset the whole way from Budapest to Manchester when he saw that a woman was sitting in the seat he had chosen.</p>
<p>His mother, Adi, said that the window seat, where he can lean his head against the wall, helps her &#8220;very reactive&#8221; six-year-old stay calm in the air.</p>
<p>She paid more when she booked her flight on Buzz, the budget airline&#8217;s Polish branch because she knew it was important for a comfortable trip.</p>
<p>But when Adi got on the plane, he saw that Ryan&#8217;s seat was taken by a woman. When asked, the stranger said she had been given the window seat, too, and she wouldn&#8217;t move.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ryan was really upset and anxious and he cried,&#8217; Adi told<a class="class" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/news/woman-refused-move-crying-son-28426259" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Â The Mirror</a>. &#8216;He didn&#8217;t understand how this could happen. We sat separately and it was really stressful.&#8217;</p>
<p>As a consolation, he was given an aisle seat, but he spent most of the flight crying in his dad&#8217;s lap.</p>
<p>&#8216;My poor child was crying. People gave him sweets and were so kind,&#8217; Adi said.</p>
<p>The incident happened in August, and Adi says she&#8217;s still waiting for RyanAir to explain what happened and give her money for it.</p>
<p>Ryan&#8217;s seat was not double booked, the airline said. Instead, the &#8220;misunderstanding&#8221; was caused by a &#8220;single IT glitch,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>The flight was full, so there were no other window seats available for the family. This meant that they had to sit apart.</p>

<p>The spokesman said: &#8216;Buzz regrets the inconvenience caused to Ms. Bandli and her son and a member of our customer services team will contact them directly.&#8217;</p>
<p>Adi said that a representative told her that the problem happened because they had booked a seat near an emergency exit and Ryan was too young to sit there safely.</p>
<p>But Adi replied that they were definitely not put in a row near an emergency exit.</p>
<p>A source has reached out to RyanAir for comment.</p>
