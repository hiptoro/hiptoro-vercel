			<p>It&#8217;s extremely risky to use ATMs at all times especially at night. For the same, cubicles have been constructed and guards have been assigned on duty. But people have taken the responsibility of their safety on themselves and have positioned their dogs to protect them at all costs.</p>
<p>It has been proven to be very effective. When people take a first glance at these big canine friends, they don&#8217;t even think to come near their hooman. All it asks in return is a treat. &#8220;This is a good strategy. I would be way too distracted trying to pet the dogs to steal her information,&#8221; one social media user alternatively stated.</p>
<p>Photos are circulating over the internet where people have positioned their dogs to protect them from risks at ATM.</p>
<p>Here are some pooches who took their job seriously and protected their humans from any risk while withdrawing from the ATM.</p>
