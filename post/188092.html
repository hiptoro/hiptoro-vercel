			<p>We have said many times that we don&#8217;t deserve dogs but what about cats? Do we deserve them? Maybe we don&#8217;t because they are too adorable . They literally melt our hearts and we are sort of obsessed with them. Aren&#8217;t we?</p>
<p>But did you know that cats are not just adorable but they also relieve stress? That&#8217;s right! According to a study done 20 years ago, it was revealed that cats can lower stress levels and make us feel better. In fact, people who own cats are 40% less likely to die from a heart attack and that&#8217;s a pretty impressive number.</p>
<p>While many claims to be dog people, there are more than 80 million cats in America alone coming second to fish. Well, if you don&#8217;t have a cat, you can at least enjoy their shenanigans by looking at some of the most adorable cats pictures.</p>
<p>Scroll down to see 10 of the best pictures that prove cats are too cute to handle.</p>
