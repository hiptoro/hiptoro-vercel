			<p>Misery loves company, and you can find such a company on social media. People are always there to share your pain, or maybe tease you a little for it. It&#8217;s also a convenient place to relive your awkward phase and find out how you stack up against other elementary school memories.</p>
<p>Even for those of us who escaped elementary school with few blemishes and flawless records, we likely have at least one scar: pencil lead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>If it seems like getting poked with a pencil is a rite of passage when you&#8217;re in grade school, well, there&#8217;s a reason for that.</h2>

<p>Twitter user @Los_Writer wanted to meet more like that and, boy, did he get what he wanted. Although he has since taken her tweets private, the evidence lives on, as are all those pencil shards stuck on people&#8217;s bodies so many years after graduation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>We&#8217;ve all been there, right? A simple hit, in the past, that stays with you for the rest of your damn life. It&#8217;s like a reminder that is constant in nature, of where you were and what was going through your mind when it happened.</h2>

<p>The pencil lead gets stuck under the skin, either from malice or sheer clumsiness, and the mark it leaves never goes away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As much as you want to erase the circumstances around that little gray dot, you can&#8217;t. This guy will never run with a sharp, sharp pencil in hand again.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s certainly a lasting reminder, isn&#8217;t it? Generally speaking, people can always remember the accompanying history of lead under the skin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And how many brushes with more serious matters have people had. Sibling rivalry is tough when you&#8217;re growing up!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Seriously, the number of leads transferred from one sibling to another sibling is too high.</h2>
<p>The task is tough, but man, it&#8217;s not worth the stabbing. Perhaps that is a lesson in itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Furthermore, the number of people who have been directly attacked with pencils is alarming.</h2>

<p>But the credit goes, I suppose, to the one who at least tried to apologize for it, albeit years later. Making amends is very important!</p>

<p>The good news is, if you got poked really well, you would find out who cared about you. Good work, aunt!</p>
