			<p>A dad shaved off his daughter&#8217;s hair after he found out she was being cruel to a girl with cancer.</p>
<p>The dad caused quite a stir online after he explained the method of discipline that he used when he found out his daughter was being cyberbullied.</p>
<p>The dad explained the situation in the <a href="https://mysticalraven.com/relationships/22009/dad-shaves-his-daughters-hair-for-bullying-a-girl-with-cancer-and-pulling-off-her-wig?dRqV=n0WJuFevL0&amp;fbclid=IwAR1CmUXpmwWFIsB46D-7uUqFEaQcC883_ZfysOq8i75qZvlLcbkfNG74RUw">post</a>.</p>
<p>“My ex-wife and I have a sixteen-year-old daughter together of which I have full custody (she has moved on with her new family)… My daughter recently got in trouble at school for making fun of a student that lost her hair from cancer treatment. Including pulling off her wig,” he wrote.</p>
<p>He said that his daughter and the girl have bad blood, but that it didn&#8217;t excuse her actions.</p>
<p>The father claims that the other girl said that the girl&#8217;s boyfriend was using her for sex and then it went from there.</p>
<p>“At some point, the other girl mentioned how my daughter’s boyfriend was just using her for sex (this was actually a big shock to me as I had no idea she was sexually active) and called my daughter a sl*t,” he wrote.</p>
<p>“That’s what escalated the situation and resulted in the wig incident. Supposedly they have been arguing in class ever since my daughter started dating the guy in question. Basically just stupid teenage ‘he said she said’ nonsense.”</p>
<p>He said that he gave his daughter a choice of punishments for her actions.</p>

<p>She could either have her electronics taken away or have her hair shaved off.</p>
<p>“I will throw away every single piece of electronics she owns and never buy her another again (this was just to coerce her into choosing option 2)” he wrote.</p>
<p>“She will go to the hairdresser and get a cue ball haircut. As in, a completely shaved head, as bald as the hairdresser can do.”</p>
<p>His daughter chose option 2 and had all of her hair shaved off, something her mom and the rest of the internet weren&#8217;t happy about.</p>
<p>The dad was accused of embarrassing his daughter by taking his punishment too far.</p>
<p>“That is a form of abuse. There are other ways to discipline her. Humiliation is never the way to handle a problem with children. Before anyone asks, yes I have children, five in fact,” one person <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DavidAvocadoWolfe/posts/10158207426121512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>“Yes. Poor role model. Violence and abuse only beget more. So many other ways to have a positive result,” another added.</p>
<p>However, others believe the dad made the right choice.</p>
<p>“Too bad she didn’t learn compassion earlier. Hopefully, this lesson works,” one person wrote.</p>
<p>“Good for the dad. Obviously, he did not teach her the bullying. Disciplined for bad behavior is not being a bad parent. I applaud him for taking responsibility as a parent,” said another.</p>
<p>Do you think the punishment was too far?</p>
