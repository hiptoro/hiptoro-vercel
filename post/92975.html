<p>Henry County Sheriff Monte Belew identified 46-year-old T.J. Brown, 42-year-old Heather Scarbrough and 82-year-old Charles Brown as the suspects who were all arrested by deputies.</p>
<p>All three suspects have been charged with aggravated child abuse, aggravated animal cruelty, possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony, manufacturing of marijuana, possession of drug paraphernalia and cruelty to animals. Brown was also charged with possession of a firearm.</p>
<p>On Thursday, deputies with the department raided the mobile-home that had several outbuildings.</p>
<p>The 18-month-old boy was found in a 4&#8217;x4&#8242; cage in a living room. Also, the boy had only a few toys and did not even have a blanket.</p>

<h3>What else was found?</h3>
<p>Next to the cage were three buckets of mice, and just three feet away was a 10ft boa constrictor. Eight snakes were found inside the room, in total.</p>
<p>The animals found at the home included: 86 chickens and roosters, 56 dogs, 10 rabbits, 4 parakeets, 3 cats, 8 snakes, one pheasant, 531 rodents, one gecko and three sugar gliders.</p>

<p>Also recovered from the home were 127 marijuana plants and 17 guns. Maggots and cockroaches were all over the house.</p>
<p>Animal Rescue Corps assisted with animal removal, with some being found dead.</p>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;In our community children are treasured. They&#8217;re treasured very highly and the slightest allegation that one may be in danger causes a large number of people to spring into action. We&#8217;re going to investigate this and every allegation of child abuse extremely closely,&#8217; said District Attorney Matt Stowe.</p>
<p id="ext-gen81" class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;These things oftentimes can be hidden, especially when it&#8217;s in a remote or rural area. But even in an urban area, the truth is we never really know what our neighbors next door are doing. It&#8217;s important that this serves as a warning that if you see something out of place that you let someone know.&#8217;</p>
