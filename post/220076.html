			<p>In the last episode of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle&#8217;s docuseries, Tyler Perry said that the couple &#8220;had no plan&#8230; they just wanted to be free.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 53-year-old American actor and director helped the Duke and Duchess of Sussex move to the US by giving them the use of his $18 million Beverly Hills home.</p>
<p>He says in the program:</p>
<blockquote><p>They just wanted to be free. They wanted to be free to love and be happy. They didn&#8217;t&#8230; They did not have a plan. Everyone&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s this&#8230;&#8221; There was no plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>As part of the Sussexes&#8217; multimillion-dollar deal with Netflix, the first three episodes of Harry &amp; Meghan were streamed last week. The last three hour-long episodes came out today.</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex moved to California after saying in 2020 that they would stop being royals.</p>
<p>Before moving to their own $14.65 million house in Montecito, California, the couple and their one-year-old son Archie lived in Perry&#8217;s Beverly Hills home for a few months.</p>
<p>Perry had said before that he wanted to help the couple because it was &#8220;a very hard time for them&#8221; and he wanted to &#8220;support them&#8221; in any way he could.</p>
<p>The director also mentioned on the Today show how moved he was by Harry and Meghan&#8217;s love.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;What I know about the two of them &#8211; and I wish the world knew &#8211; how much these two people love each other.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>They found each other, out of all these odds against them finding each other, they found each other. The love they have is really, really moving and I wanted to do anything I could to support them.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also said this about Meghan and Harry:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I don&#8217;t have that, what she and Harry have, I don&#8217;t want it. That&#8217;s really amazing.</p></blockquote>
<p>In an interview with The Cut, Meghan, 41, talked about her relationship with Tyler and said that he reached out to her after she married Harry, 38, for the first time in 2018.</p>
<p>She told him that he had told her he was praying for her and that he &#8220;got&#8221; how hard things were for her.</p>
<p>Meghan says that Tyler also told her that she could talk to him if she ever needed help, so she did.</p>
<p>She soon told him about her problems, and even though they had never met in person, they became close.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sometimes, you can tell your life story to a stranger on a plane as opposed to some of the people that are closest to you,</p></blockquote>
<p>she told a source.</p>
<p>The outlet says that Tyler&#8217;s offer to let the couple live in his house &#8220;became a big part of why Meghan and Harry started their new life in Southern California.&#8221;</p>
