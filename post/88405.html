			<p>It is quite difficult to accept the fact that our parents are cooler than us. But, the truth is they actually are. Whether we like it or not, all of us go through the phase of being parents. Usually, we the kids complain about our parents not being very wide-minded. But probably they don&#8217;t because they have prior experiences.</p>
<p>Whatever may be the case, but, the fact is there are instances where we can see our parents are cooler than us. We all aspire to have cool parents. And having them is no less than a treasure. You believe or not but the parents have always been cooler in their times. And if you don&#8217;t trust us, the pictures below will surely change your mind.</p>
<p>So scroll down and have fun!</p>
