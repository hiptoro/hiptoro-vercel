<h2>A jungle nation</h2>

<p>Panama as you know has lush greenery. This is one reason why this area has plenty of rainfall.</p>
<h2>This heavy amount of rain causes yearly floods in Panama.</h2>

<p>Rains aren&#8217;t a big deal for 35-year-old Manuel Calderon and his dog, Fulo. But unfortunately, this time when it rained heavily, things got out of control for them.</p>
<h2>Heavy rains struck the area</h2>

<p>Due to heavy rain in San Miguelito, Panama, the river became a deadly torrent of water</p>
<h2>A walk by the water</h2>

<h2>In a video, Calderon and Fulo are seen hanging out by the water’s edge as the river rapidly moves by.</h2>

<h2>He’s trying to navigate the edge of the water when trouble strikes.</h2>

<h2>Before they know it, the dog is swept away.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-143831 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/7-10.png" alt="" width="630" height="630" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/7-10.png 630w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/7-10-300x300.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/7-10-150x150.png 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/7-10-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<h2>Without skipping a beat, Calderon dives into the torrential flood and swims after Fulo.</h2>
<p>The incident could have taken Calderon&#8217;s life. But without thinking about it once, we went to save his best friend. It proves his pure love for his pooch.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-143832 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/8-8.png" alt="" width="630" height="630" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/8-8.png 630w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/8-8-300x300.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/8-8-150x150.png 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/8-8-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px" /></p>
<p>“I was focused on the dog. And thank God I managed to grab him…I threw him onto the bank and got out some meters later,” Calderon said in a local report.</p>
<p>When asked why he risked his life for Fulo, Calderon had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>“An animal, just for being an animal, does not deserve to be disregarded, because it is a life after all. I ask you to take care of them because they also have feelings.”</p></blockquote>
