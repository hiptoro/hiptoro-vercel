			Breastfeeding Mom Had The Best Reaction After Being Told To Cover Up

			<p>A mom, who was breastfeeding her child in a public place had a hilarious response to a judge stranger who asked her to &#8216;cover up&#8217;. It is not the first time that people have argued upon whether women should openly nurse or practice discretion.  In the corner of a restaurant in Cobo San Lucas, a woman named Melanie Dudley was feeding her 3-month-old son when a stranger approached her and asked her to cover up.</p>
<p>Dudley, who has her back to other diners at the restaurant said in an interview, that she was left speechless when she heard the strangers demand. The mother of the 3-year old decided not to give a verbal reply to the man, and rather quite literally performed an action that was pretty savage. She threw a blanket on top of her head and face to simply prove that she had covered up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was on vacation in Cabo San Lucas with my entire family and a man asked me to cover myself,&#8221; the breastfeeding mom told Hiptoro. &#8220;I&#8217;m usually discreet but we were seated in the back of the restaurant.&#8221; Dudley also told us that at first, she had used a nursing cover, but her baby. couldn&#8217;t tolerate the heat so she removed it &#8220;I did have the cover on, but it was so hot. It was like, 95 degrees, and my little baby was sweating,&#8221; she recalled. &#8220;I said, &#8216;You know what? I&#8217;m on vacation, I&#8217;m taking this off.'&#8221;</p>
<p>She recalled the moment when the man approached with his demand, Dudley said she&#8217;d been &#8220;kind of stunned&#8221;. For one moment she games it a thought and came up with an idea. She asked her husband to pass her the nursing cover. &#8220;I just put it over my head. I don&#8217;t know why,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t like a salacious fight or anything. That was just my response. I had no words so I thought, I&#8217;ll just cover my head instead.&#8221; Her husband took the opportunity to capture this silly moment and later shared it with his mother, who further posted it on Facebook. One of her friends, Carol Lockwood, shared it on her page after seeking her permission — where it became a huge thing of its own with over 137k likes and 225k shares.</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend&#8217;s daughter-in-law was told to &#8216;cover up&#8217; while feeding her baby, so she did! I&#8217;ve never met her, but I think she&#8217;s AWESOME!!! With permission, I&#8217;ve made this post public — I&#8217;m SO over people shaming women for nursing!!! PS: To reduce speculation: it was a man who asked her to cover up, it was 90 degrees and extremely humid, and, no, she wasn&#8217;t in a Muslim country disrespecting traditions,&#8221; Lockwood captioned the now-viral photo.</p>

<p>Dudley, who is also the mother of 4-year-old twins, revealed that she mostly tries to cover up whenever she has to nurses in public. Although she breastfed her older boys for a year, she said, &#8220;it was impossible to do both at the same time when we were out so I never had this problem. With my little one, it&#8217;s so much easier to nurse out in public.&#8221; Taking about the response the viral photo received on the Internet, she said she&#8217;d been pretty surprised by it. Although the post received a few negative comments, but majority of them have been supportive, she said.</p>
