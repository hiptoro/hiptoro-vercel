			<p>A young worker at McDonald&#8217;s shocked his coworkers when he quit in the middle of his shift because he didn&#8217;t want to clean the dirty cooking equipment.</p>
<p>The viral video from a fast food restaurant in New Zealand has split the internet since it was posted on TikTok.</p>
<p>The video of the sudden walkout starts with a shot of a sink full of dirty grills and fryers that the young worker was told to start cleaning.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hell no, I am not cleaning that, I ain&#8217;t cleaning that,</p></blockquote>
<p>he said.</p>
<blockquote><p>Actually, I quit!</p></blockquote>

<p>His boss can be heard yelling at him, and his confused coworkers are pleading with him to stay.</p>
<p>A woman who is upset about a coworker&#8217;s sudden departure can be seen waving her arms around.</p>
<blockquote><p>No! Get back here!</p></blockquote>
<p>the manager is heard screaming.</p>
<p>A colleague added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, f*** that!</p></blockquote>
<p>The young worker sticks to his decision and leaves.</p>
<blockquote><p>I quit, I&#8217;m leaving Maccas. See you on the flip side b*****!</p></blockquote>
<p>he said.</p>

<blockquote><p>They really thought I was going to clean that,</p></blockquote>
<p>the crew member captioned the video, which sparked a divided response from viewers.</p>
<blockquote><p>I work at McDonald&#8217;s, I feel u,</p></blockquote>
<p>one viewer commented.</p>
<p>But many people didn&#8217;t care and didn&#8217;t think the job was as bad as the McDonald&#8217;s worker said it was.</p>
<blockquote><p>Not even that bad it’s like 20 mins of work,</p></blockquote>
<p>one viewer wrote.</p>
<p>Another added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kids don’t wanna work, lazy as hell.</p></blockquote>
<p>Others said they wouldn&#8217;t have minded doing the job and would have been happy to do it.</p>
<blockquote><p>I loved dishes so much, it meant I didn’t have to work on orders,</p></blockquote>
<p>one wrote.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, there are 170 McDonald&#8217;s restaurants with a total of 10,000 employees.</p>
