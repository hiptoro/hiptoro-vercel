			<p>Being pregnant and welcoming a baby into your life is the most life changing, precious and delightful event in one&#8217;s life. But let&#8217;s not forget that it comes with plenty of changes, responsibilities and challenges that you have to deal with every single day. You have to constantly keep an eye on the newborns and ensure that they are properly fed, looked after, dressed and cared for.  It certainly is an overwhelming experience for the new parents to be.</p>
<p>On top of that, parents also have to find work around to make changes in their typical routines as they welcome a child.  Parents have to revolve their world around what their child needs and wants because now the child comes before anyone else in the world. Parenthood is not the same for everyone. Each person has their problems, challenges and experience that may differ from everyone else.</p>
<p>Before the mother delivers the baby, she goes through a lot of challenges and changes that only a mother can understand. For example, a mom to have to adjust and look after the changing body and keep herself healthy. It might sound easy but is way more difficult than anyone could probably imagine.  A pregnant woman requires a lot of care from her family. The family needs to be supportive of them and the challenges she faces during this phase of her life. Not only families but even strangers at a public place come forward to help a pregnant woman.</p>
<p>One man on Reddit wasn&#8217;t happy with the special treatment that some pregnant women expect, and so he refused to give up his seat when he was asked by a heavily pregnant woman to get up and give her his seat. He did mention his reason for doing so and asked users on Reddit to share their opinions on the actions he performed. Based on the justification he shared in his post, most replies were not in his favour.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-183543 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-88.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="750" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-88.jpg 500w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-88-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>The original poster of his post began by writing, &#8220;I take the bus to and from work (car got totaled about a month ago, still waiting on insurance to reimburse me so I can get a new one), and right now on public transit you have to social distance. This means limited seating.&#8221;</p>
<p>He further wrote, &#8220;At my job, I’m literally on my feet all day, and I work 10 hour shifts. It sucks but the pay is good, so I can deal, but after a long day, my feet are sore AF. I genuinely cherish the time I spend sitting on the bus ride home, knowing I have to walk another 15-20 minutes to my house from the bus stop. Which means more time on my feet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He explained in his post that he was unhappy with the incident that took place the previous night, he was faced with a situation that he disliked after a pregnant woman boarded the bus and found there were no seats available. &#8220;I’m the closest to her, so she starts giving me the imploring eyes. I had my headphones on and tried to pretend I couldn’t see her, but once she started talking to me it became inevitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>He described his response, &#8220;I wasn’t rude or anything, I just told her no, I’ve had a long day and my feet are sore. I don’t want to give up my seat. She started crying about how she’s a pregnant single mom, and I told her I’m sorry, but that was her personal choice and she can’t expect other people to accommodate her life choices.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-183544 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-87.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="372" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-87.jpg 500w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-87-300x223.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>He also mentioned the reason, &#8220;We live in a state where birth control and abortions are free, so I don’t know why this should be my problem. It’s not my fault she decided to have a baby when she can’t afford a car.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-183545 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-87.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-87.jpg 500w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-87-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>His refusal lead to a series of events: &#8220;After going back and forth for a bit, an old man finally shouted that I’m a “worthless punk” and offered his seat to the lady,&#8221; which was followed by &#8220;As they were trading seats, the bus driver had to slam the brakes for whatever reason, and the pregnant lady and the old man both fell. They started yelling at me, calling me all sorts of nasty names, but I just looked the other way and ignored it.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the OP got home, he shared what happened with his family and was bashed by them for having a selfish approach towards the pregnant lady. Due to the negative reaction he received at home, he decided to ask Reddit users if he was actually wrong, and the response was filled with criticism.</p>
<p>The top comment stated, &#8220;Did you know that being heavily pregnant really alters your balance, let alone the tired thing? No &#8211; you didn&#8217;t ask her to be pregnant, but you can, as an able-bodied otherwise healthy person just choose to be nice. By being a selfish [sic] grumpy bugger a heavily pregnant person and an old person fell over. Bringing up the contraception/abortion/&#8217;breeding&#8217; angle too really makes you an [expletive]. I bet you&#8217;re a real &#8216;nice guy.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Another comment added, &#8220;Here [sic] being a single mother who has to take the bus is a &#8220;choice&#8221; and yet, his car accident is just unfortunate circumstances. Really, if he didn&#8217;t want to deal with other people he really shouldn&#8217;t have taken the bus. He should have made sure he had a car, since his life choices make his feet hurt.&#8221;</p>
<p>What do you think about the man&#8217;s approach towards the pregnant lady? If you were in his position, what would you have done? Have you ever encountered such an incident in your surroundings?</p>
<p>If yes, what was it like? Do you think pregnant women deserve to be treated in a special way, or there should be laws regarding it?</p>
