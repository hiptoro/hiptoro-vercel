			<p>Have you ever been conned by a salesperson? I guess some of you might have encountered sneaky sales skills. And had made you believe that there is really a need to buy a product.</p>
<p>However, these salespeople can easily convince you to buy that you weren’t even planning to get. But keeping a pet is like having a kid at home. They are the best companions no matter what breed they are.</p>
<p>Let us see how people who got conned when they were getting pets.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>This is Fubla, the Sphynx cat. She was bald when she was a kitten but then she started to suddenly grow fur</strong></h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>My mother was told that it was a mixed breed of a hound dog and a chihuahua. 6 years have passed, but the chihuahua hasn’t revealed itself yet</strong></h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>I wanted to buy that dog but got this one instead</strong></h2>

<p>According to the latest sources, there has been a surge in cases regarding <a href="https://twitter.com/actionfrauduk/status/1257586950397181958">pet scams</a>. Especially taking the advantage of this coronavirus lockdown people have been fooled as the demand for furry companions has increased significantly.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>I was told that this was a chow-chow, and we didn’t think he’d grow up to be so big</strong></h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>We were assured that he would not grow heavier than 4.4 lb. But the dog weighs 15.4 lb now and continues to grow. I think I got a polar bear</strong></h2>
