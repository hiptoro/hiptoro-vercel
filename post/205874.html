			<p>There are rules in schools. The policies set in place vary greatly from school to school and district to district. If a student moves to another school district, they may have to adapt to a new set of rules.</p>
<p>Sometimes the rules a school makes are meant to keep the students safe and create a positive atmosphere on campus. Sometimes the rules seem outdated and even discriminatory. When it comes to a student&#8217;s appearance, sometimes schools make rules around what is and is not okay. Sometimes a school&#8217;s dress code is too restrictive and not necessary.</p>
<p>A woman and her son moved from Ohio to Texas. Their son was going to be a student at East Bernard High School. She didn&#8217;t expect to have a problem with the process.</p>
<p>Her son is a good kid. He wants to go to school. Due to one of the school&#8217;s policies, Bullock didn&#8217;t finish filling out the paperwork. She has been teaching her son.</p>
<p>She feels that the school policy needs to be changed. There is a policy about hair for male students. Male students must have their hair cut above their ears according to the policy. She doesn&#8217;t feel that her son should have to cut his hair just to go to high school.</p>
<p>You can watch the video to learn more about the hair policy at East Bernard High School.</p>

<p>Do you think it&#8217;s discrimination to require male students to have their hair cut? Do you think your local school district has outdated policies that should be changed?</p>
