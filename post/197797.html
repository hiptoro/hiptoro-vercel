<h2>1. A New And Spontaneous Romance.</h2>
<p>From Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/q5pkjm/tifu_by_introducing_my_widower_dad_to_my_husbands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OnwardTogether83</a>:</p>
<p>We have been married for five and a half years. My mom passed away when I was 16 and my husband and I only had one parent at the wedding.</p>
<p>During the wedding planning, our parents met and found out how much they had in common. They danced at the wedding reception after a few glasses of wine.</p>
<p>We noticed a little bit of flirting between them but didn&#8217;t think much of it until they started seeing each other a lot after the wedding. It was weird for us that our parents were ambiguously dating each other, but we didn&#8217;t care because they seemed happy.</p>
<p>My husband and his mom walked down the aisle to meet my dad. My parents became husband and wife after they said their vows. We became. There are stepsiblings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Meeting Parents On The First Date.</h2>
<p>From Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ozbdzc/tifu_by_inviting_a_tinder_date_over_to_my_house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BLINDANDREFINED</a>:</p>
<p>My lack of dating life has me turning to date apps. This one is from the dating app.</p>
<p>I had been talking to this guy for a few days, and everything was going swimmingly. We were both looking for the same things. He didn&#8217;t live too far away and his pictures were cute. All seemed normal.</p>
<p>He was invited to cook some burgers in my backyard. I told him to bring some bacon for the burgers. He said he would be over soon.</p>
<p>I expected him to be over in 15 minutes. I started grilling the burgs. He messaged me half an hour later, saying that he had driven by a couple of times and chickened out. Are you sure you want me to come over? I said come on, I&#8217;m hungry, but I thought it was a red flag.</p>
<p>The guy is much different than the one in the picture. I can move on. He did not take a breath from the moment he walked up. I knew his life story from his aunt who hated their grandma to his father who likes to collect. Not a single breath.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>I thought he was nervous. I put the burgers on, and when they&#8217;re ready he pulls out a Ziploc from his pocket with two pieces of bacon in it. He only puts them on his burger. Okay&#8230;</p>
<p>He did not stop talking the entire time we sat down at the patio table to eat. He pulls out his pocket when we sit down. a vial? There is a cork in it. It is filled with black powder.</p>
<p>If he was going to snort something strange or build some sand art, he must have noticed that I was staring at it. He said, &#8220;Oh,&#8221; all super casual. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to INTRODUCE YOU TO MY MOTHER.&#8221;</p>
<p>I stared at him for a long time and I didn&#8217;t know what to do. &#8220;I like to bring her to any important event in my life. She also has ashes in this necklace I&#8217;m wearing, and in this ring, I have on, and this half-sleeve tattoo is for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t judge people based on their grief cycles, we all cope differently, and I respect that. The boy put his mother&#8217;s ashes on the table for our first date. I couldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I made an excuse about having to clock in and finish my work because he finished his burger. At 9:30 pm. He texted me before he even got to his car and told me, &#8220;My mother really liked you, I can&#8217;t wait to see you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him that I didn&#8217;t feel a connection with him or his mother.</p>

<h2>3. Stumbling Upon A Horrific Scene.</h2>
<p>From Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/tinkwk/tifu_by_eating_candy_in_such_a_childish_fashion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pllaidllama</a>:</p>
<p>I stayed up into the wee hours to eat easter candy and play video games, which I don&#8217;t do often.</p>
<p>Does anyone else like eggs? This time of year, they sell neon-colored malted milk ball eggs. I used to do this stupid thing when I was a kid, where I would lick them and then put the color on my lips and I did this last night with a blue one.</p>
<p>I forgot all about it and fell asleep on the couch with the lights on and the TV still on. By the time I come, I see my husband fumbling with his phone after I heard shouting, panicking sounds, and I was being shaken violently.</p>
<p>I kind of&#8230; flapped my arms angrily and said something like, &#8220;Whazwrongwitchyou?!&#8221;</p>
<p>He thought I was choking when he walked out on his wife and he thought he was going to call the police. It&#8217;s the dumbest thing I&#8217;ve ever had to explain in our marriage when I told him it was candy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. The Mystery Of The Same Last Names.</h2>
<p>From Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/f7rqs6/tifu_by_asking_an_unmarried_couple_how_they_had/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whatmia</a>:</p>
<p>Sometimes people get married at the courthouse and then have a friends and family reception at a later date, which is why I used to be a wedding photographer. When I first meet them, they are married.</p>
<p>One day&#8230; I&#8217;m having a consultation, they bring a child, maybe 8 years old, and we put him in front of the office tv while we talk. It&#8217;s not uncommon for courthouse marriage couples to have kids together.</p>
<p>They write me a deposit check after the meeting. Both their names and last names are on the check.</p>
<p>My brain does maths and I figure&#8230; Joint checking account + same last name + kid in tow = they are already married so I say&#8230;&#8221;You two are prepared, you already have new checks printed with the same last name.&#8221; To which the bride replied&#8230; &#8220;I&#8217;m kinda still married to his brother.&#8221; And she ended that story with &#8220;&#8230;most of his family doesn&#8217;t approve.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we continued to plan a wedding between this little boy&#8217;s Mom and his new Uncle&#8217;s Dad, I was not sure what to say as he watched cartoons in front of my TV.</p>
