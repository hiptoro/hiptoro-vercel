<p>In the late 1990s, Adam Sandler met his future wife. Rob Schneider, a friend of Sandler&#8217;s, suggested Jacqueline (Jackie) Titone as a budding actress for the role of Sandler in the film Big Daddy. Their deep love started when Jackie was cast in a modest waitressing part.</p>

<p>Adam and Jackie started dating after they clicked. The pair had already planned their future together by the time the movie Big Daddy hit theatres. Adam was quite proud of Jackie&#8217;s conversion to Judaism because he himself is a devout Jew. They tied the knot in 2003. In Malibu, they were married. Meatball, Adam&#8217;s bulldog, was the best &#8220;guy&#8221; and even sported a canine tailcoat. The couple welcomed their first daughter, Sadie Madison, in 2006, and their second, Sunny, in 2008.</p>

<p>The proposal, according to Adam, was somewhat awkward. &#8220;I played basketball that afternoon, trying to calm down, and then I was driving, I was saying the stuff out loud and trying to, you know, make sure I hit all of the right things so she would remember nice stuff, and I did all right,&#8221; he recalled.</p>

<p>Over the course of their more than 20 years of marriage, Adam and Jackie have experienced a lot of love and romance. In 2020, Sandler sent his wife a heartfelt message of congratulations, writing, &#8220;22 years ago today we locked eyes and fell deeply. Enjoy the following 22 years, young woman. You have my undying love, girl. Adam claims that their good relationship is the result of their simply spending time together.</p>

<p>In addition to being a devoted husband, Adam is a devoted father. Despite his busy schedule, he makes an effort to spend as much time as possible with his daughter since &#8220;my kids offer me the most joy.&#8221; But like all other parents, he worries about them since being a father is not always easy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve discovered in life that you should rock your child till their distress subsides. You are rocked even though they are not angry. You&#8217;re anxious all the time because you want your child to be content.</p>

<p>The actor plays a comedic role on TV, but in real life, he is quite serious and family-oriented. Making sure that everyone in the family is alright, he asserts, is of utmost importance. The deep bond between Adam and Jackie is evidence that it is possible to strike a balance between job and family life. Simply be there for one another and spend time together.</p>
