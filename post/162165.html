<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you know what selfless animals deserve? Well, they deserve love, care, and our attention. They don’t deserve to get stuck in fishing lines. But still, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">a cute little puppy, named Lucy was found stuck in a fishing line. We know that’s terrible. We can’t even imagine what this cutie must have gone through. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, Lucy was rescued on time and she made a quick recovery. </span></p>
<h2>Just look at her eyes! Poor Lucy never deserved to be in this place.</h2>
