			<p>A woman &#8220;accidentally sent her salary to a stranger,&#8221; and when she asked for it back, she got a very rude answer.</p>
<p>Malaysian Fahada Bistari wanted to give her mom a surprise by sending her paycheck to her, but she accidentally sent it to an unknown bank account number.</p>
<p>The woman went on TikTok and broke down as she talked about what happened in a video that went viral.</p>
<p>Find out what happened when $515,000 was sent to one man&#8217;s wrong bank account below&#8230;</p>
<p>Bistari told her followers:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today I got my first salary.</p>
<p>It’s not much as I had just worked a few days. I banked in the money to my mother but long story short, I accidentally banked it to another person.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bistari may not have realized she had made a mistake until her confused mother told her that she had not gotten the money.</p>
<p>When Bistari found out to whom she had sent her salary, she got in touch with the person and told them what had happened.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=221767" rel="attachment wp-att-221767"><img data-dominant-color="8c7971" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #8c7971;" decoding="async" class="not-transparent aligncenter size-full wp-image-221767" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-18-at-17.50.33-561x659-1.png" alt="" width="561" height="659" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-18-at-17.50.33-561x659-1.png 561w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screenshot-2022-12-18-at-17.50.33-561x659-1-255x300.png 255w" sizes="(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px" /></a></p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t seem to care much about her, and she was supposedly told that the mistake could be written off as &#8220;charity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emotional, Bistari continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>My mother gave me the phone number of the person and I called, texted and WhatsApped them. Finally, they asked me to think of it as a donation to them.</p>
<p>It’s not that I don’t want to donate but my pay is very little and I wanted to give it to my mother.</p></blockquote>
<div style="width: 540px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-0-1" width="540" height="960" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Woman-Accidentally-Transfers-Her-Salary-to-Stranger-and-Gets-a-Fitting-Response.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Woman-Accidentally-Transfers-Her-Salary-to-Stranger-and-Gets-a-Fitting-Response.mp4">https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Woman-Accidentally-Transfers-Her-Salary-to-Stranger-and-Gets-a-Fitting-Response.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>Bistari was lucky because the person seemed to have changed their mind, and after some &#8220;added drama,&#8221; she got her money back.</p>
<p>Since it was shared, the TikToker&#8217;s post has been seen an incredible 3.9 million times, and viewers have shown her a lot of sympathies.</p>
<p>One wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have tears in my eyes watching this. if this chapter is about mom, she will be in tears… There are many lessons from this video. Sincerely, I hope you have a good reply.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t be sad .. God willing, you will have more sustenance,</p></blockquote>
<p>a second said.</p>
<blockquote><p>Believe it.</p></blockquote>
<p>A third said:</p>
<blockquote><p>H<span class="Y2IQFc" lang="en">opefully that person will be open to give back, be patient sister.</span></p></blockquote>
