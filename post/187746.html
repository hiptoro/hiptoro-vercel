<h2>Five years ago, the Brinks made a $57,000 purchase of a 21-acre property in Kentucky and turned it into a sustainable tiny house village.</h2>

<h2>4 family members share 6 tiny houses in total—the parents’ house, two separate houses for Lennox and Brodey, a double bathroom house, a pool house, and a guest house.</h2>

<h2>The parents’ house is not only the most expensive in the property, coming in at $9,000, but also the most spacious at 280 square feet.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-187751 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-67.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-67.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-67-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>We spoke to Lennox Brinks, the girl who lives in this tiny village, about what it’s like to be part of an alternative lifestyle. “It’s absolutely amazing. I love living in a tiny house and am so glad my parents decided to move us into this arrangement. I lived in a regular house for the first 14 years of my life, but now that I have a taste of a tiny house, I love it. I think I’m going to have a regular house when I first go out into the world, but maybe when my kids grow up, I would come back to this type of living.”</p>
<p>“I love having my own space and being able to customize my house to my liking. Not to mention, if I stay up late at night or have friends over, I don’t have to worry about being quiet because my parents are across the yard. I think this arrangement has helped me become independent and has helped me ease into the college atmosphere because I am used to having my own space.”</p>
<h2>Living with less is both cheap and friendly to the environment</h2>
<p>The most important advantage is that “we live more sustainably now in this system. We use much less energy, because when a house is not being used, there doesn’t need to be any heating or air conditioning used. Our electricity bill since moving has gone down drastically. We have a garden and produce a lot of the food we eat from our own hands, and we also compost almost all of our food, recycle, and produce much less waste. This was the most important aspect of this arrangement to my mom and was one of the reasons we decided to live with less.”</p>
<h3>Bugs and critters are the only thing Lennox doesn’t like that much</h3>
<p>“Because our homes are separated, bugs fly or crawl in with much easier access than in a regular house. Nobody else in my family mind, but I’m scared of the creepy crawly things. Because we have animals and live in the middle of the woods, they drag little rodents in sometimes, but that’s not that bad. When I first moved, it was pretty scary to be in a house by myself in the dense wood of outside, but I’ve gotten used to that.”</p>
<p>And what about that bathroom, which is placed outside? In fact, it’s pretty convenient! “One disadvantage that everyone thinks of is the fact that the bathroom is separate from my house, so if I need to go in the middle of the night, I have to go outside. When I tell people this, they think it’s worse than it is, when in reality, it takes me like five seconds to run over there.”</p>
<h2>The living room feels cozy and has plenty of natural light.</h2>

<p>We also talked to Stephanie McQueen, the content manager of the <a href="https://tinyhousecommunity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tiny House Community</a> resource center, about the pros and cons of living in a tiny house. “The pros of living tiny are the benefits of your environment, which is to say that most people that live in tiny houses spend more time outdoors. This naturally increases overall health and happiness when you’re in nature and absorbing vitamin D on a regular basis. The cons of living tiny can be the lack of indoor entertainment space and the legality of parking tiny houses on wheels (or even building one on a foundation). Having family or friends over for holidays or dinner parties probably isn’t the most comfortable, especially if you live in climates where outdoor entertainment is not a viable option during the winter months. While we’re all still working on local zoning laws with our governments, tiny houses are still a gray area and some cities refuse to allow them.”</p>
<p>Is a tiny house better for the environment than a regular house? “Tiny houses are a great way to reduce your carbon footprint, intentionally live, improve health, and increase income. While it is a very eco-friendly way to live compared to a standard house, it also offers huge benefits in other aspects as well. Many houses use a fraction of energy compared to average homes, plus many are set up for solar power.”</p>
<p>Stephanie suggests starting from your current home. “Taking the plunge into tiny living isn’t for everyone. If you’re considering it, start by working on your current home. A tiny lifestyle can be achieved by anyone, no matter the size of your house. Get rid of excess things, reduce the amount of space you use in your house, learn to be intentional when shopping, and start the mindset shift. It may sound complicated, but it’s really not. If tiny living is for you, these transitions will be smooth and logical. The next step is learning how to get into a tiny house. At Tiny House Community, we offer guides and tips for beginners wanting to build their own tiny house.”</p>
<h2>Lennox’s and Brodey’s tiny houses don’t have bathrooms, so the kids need to step outside and use one of these two bathrooms.</h2>
