			2 Y.O. Dog Adopted After More Than 400 Days At The Wickenburg Humane Society Shelter

			<p>Sometimes, humans can be so harsh on dogs. Dogs begin the most loving creatures, and all that they do for us even end up in the shelter after being abandoned by their owners. Today, we want to share with you the journey of Lola from being abandoned with her six offsprings in a shelter. After 400 plus days, she was finally adopted and now lives in her forever home in Mesa, Arizona.</p>
<p>We spoke Kelsey Dickerson of the Humane Society to elaborate on the story.</p>
<h2>Meet Lola, the 2 Y.O. mommy doggy of 6 puppers who has ended up in an animal shelter over a year ago</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113745 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-20.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-20.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-20-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<div>In September 2019, Lola as a stray with her six puppies was brought to the Humane Society of Wickenburg, Arizona.  She took care of them and watched them being adopted one by one, and waiting for her turn to come patiently.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It does take a while for a dog to get adopted but in  Lola&#8217;s case, it took a little longer. “Adorable Lola was originally brought to the Humane Society of Wickenburg as a stray with underage puppies,” elaborated Kelsey. “After 400+ days and more than half her life spent at HSW, Lola was transferred to the Arizona Humane Society through the Project Reachout Program in hopes that a change of scenery would help her finally find her forever home.”</div>
<div>
<h2>Nobody thought she would end up staying there for over 400 days—much more than most other dogs!</h2>
</div>

<h2>But after a long wait, Lola was transferred to another shelter and was adopted within less than 24 hours</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113747 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-20.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="960" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-20.jpg 720w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-20-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>We wanted to know what is a legal way of adopting a dog and how long does the dog have to be at the shelter before getting adopted. So Kelsey told us, “While we can’t speak specifically for the Humane Society of Wickenberg, during COVID-19, pets at the Arizona Humane Society have found their forever homes in less than four days once on the adoption floor. That number was 12 days prior to the pandemic hitting.”</p>
<p>She continued: “Of course, some pets may have a little bit longer time period while waiting for the perfect family. However, AHS’ adoptable animals are able to take all the time they need because of the Arizona Humane Society’s Ethical No-Kill Philosophy, which means we never euthanize a pet due to length of stay or space in the shelter and will work to make sure every pet gets the second chance at a great life that they deserve.”</p>
<h2>Lola was originally brought into the Wickenburg Humane Society as a stray back in September of 2019</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113748 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-19.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-19.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-19-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>Along with her were 6 of her puppies, who were one-by-one adopted during her stay at the shelter</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113749 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-21.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-21.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-21-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>After spending 400 days, Lola was transferred to Phoenix, Arizona for trying her luck in getting adopted. Surprisingly, it took less than 24 hours for her adoption. More than 870 pets have been helped from such programs.</p>
<p>And shelters do run into challenges when caring for dogs, let alone mama pups who come with their own litter, as explains Kelsey:<br />
“Many shelters are simply unable to care for mama pups who come in with underage puppies or orphaned puppies who come in without a mom, due to the amount of care that is needed to keep them healthy and provide an environment that is safe for them. This is why the Arizona Humane Society has an ICU extension of its Second Chance Animal Trauma Hospital, called the Mutternity Suites, that is dedicated to providing a medically supervised, safe, quiet space for mama dogs and their pups to get the care they need before heading to a Foster Hero home.”</p>
<h2>Now, shelters aren’t legally obligated to keep animals for more than 1–7 days, depending on the state</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113750 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-19.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-19.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-19-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>But the Arizona Humane Society kept her for over 400 days until she finally got adopted last week</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113751 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-19.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-19.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/7-19-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>“Lola is a sweet, loving, happy pup who adores every single person she meets instantly. Young, energetic, and playful, this sweet girl loves to romp around with other pups who are just as spirited as she is and enjoys cuddling with her favorite humans any chance she gets! Although she is very playful, Lola is great with kids and is as smart as she is cute!” explained Kelsey.</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113752 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/8-19.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/8-19.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/8-19-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>We’ve asked Kelsey what is the most important thing that people should know about adoption.  She had this to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Adoption is not only a wonderful way to add a loving, furry companion to your home, but it is also crucial to saving the lives of homeless pets. There are so many wonderful pets with just as wonderful personalities who are hoping for a second chance at life with a home full of love and care. By choosing to adopt, not shop, you directly save the lives of pets in need while reducing needless euthanasia, pet homelessness and overpopulation in your community.”</p></blockquote>
