			<p>Nick Filippou, the artist brings to you these hilarious illustrations about his cat Minnie. He shares day-to-dau interactions with his cat and how life is like with this feline. If you have a cat at home, you will relate to these and have a great time enjoying these illustrations. The comics are called &#8220;I iz cat,&#8221; spelled in the vein of &#8220;cat-speak&#8221; similar to &#8220;I can haz cheesburger.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-128774 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-127.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="698" /></p>
<p>Nick explained the reasons and context behind his comics in an interview for Hiptoro. &#8220;So, the comics star my real-life rescue cat, Minnie. I adopted Minnie 5 years ago from a shelter in Baltimore. She was a former stray and part of a TNR program (trap neuter release) that spent most of her life living outside. The clipped ear in the comics is real, and is from her being a part of the TNR program. My first comic came from a Christmas poem I wrote about the cat’s perspective of &#8216;‘Twas the Night Before Christmas&#8217; and have been drawing them ever since. Minnie is always the inspiration.&#8221;</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-128776 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-127.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></p>
<p>Of course, the artist is an avid lover of cats. &#8220;My favorite thing about cats is how zen they are but also, at the same time, they’re little agents of chaos. Cats both relax me and make me laugh.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Minnie isn&#8217;t the first cat to rule his household. &#8220;I adopted my first cat in college (also a rescue from Baltimore) and snuck him home. I named him Binx. Of course, I got caught sneaking a cat into the house, and my dad, who was very anti-cat, wasn’t a fan. He warned me if that cat scratched any furniture, or things like that, that he would take him back to the shelter. Then, a few days later, I come home from class and see my dad snuggling with my cat in my bed. They’ve been best friends ever since. Even when I moved out a few years later, my dad told me I couldn’t take Binx with me because he loved him too much and that this was his home. It was pretty adorable. I let Binx stay with my parents and moved into an apartment.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-128777 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-124.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="698" /></p>
<p>He also volunteers at alocal rescue organization, and that&#8217;s the place he found the love of his life, Minnie. &#8220;I then started volunteering at a local rescue in Baltimore, and that’s where I met Minnie. Minnie was a very adventurous girl who still was living outside. The shelter owner would call out &#8216;Minnie!&#8217; and I’d see this adorable cat hop over the fence, returning from the woods meowing up a storm. I fell in love. I remember the shelter owner saying, &#8216;Minnie would give anything to be in a loving home.&#8217; So when I had things situated at my apartment, I knew I had to adopt her. I also adopted another cat, a tortie named Sylvia who only had 3 legs. The two lived in my apartment for a few years, until Sylvia unfortunately passed away. Sylvia was a sassy girl who I still very much missed. I was glad I was able to give her a home even if it wasn’t for that long.&#8221;</p>

<p>He told a little about his personal life, and his wife&#8217;s experience with Minnie. &#8220;When I started dating my soon-to-be wife, I remember her telling me she wasn’t really a cat person. She much preferred dogs. That was until she met Minnie. Minnie is the sweetest cat I’ve ever met, and is quite similar to a dog. She follows you EVERYWHERE, is very vocal, and loves to snuggle on your lap, your chest, even your head. She’s very loving. My wife was impressed. When we moved into our house, Minnie loved it. She had so much more room to explore and play.&#8221;</p>

<p>He told us further about his lockdown experience as well, &#8220;Lockdown has been tough for sure. Luckily, both my wife and I have been able to work from home and keep our jobs. We feel lucky. It also has allowed us to reevaluate what’s important. We had to have a small backyard wedding in June 2020 and it turned out to be a really intimate and beautiful ceremony. Of course, we took wedding photos with Minnie and Dany on our special day as well!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nick and his wife also have a pet dog. &#8220;We eventually adopted a dog, a boxer rescue also from Baltimore, who we named Dany. Dany is a very sweet girl, and MY first dog ever. I was very worried about how Dany and Minnie would get along. We read plenty of articles and watched videos on how to introduce cats and dogs and followed all the steps. We found out Dany is also a sweetheart and the two have become great friends who enjoy snuggling on the couch together. Minnie is still the queen, and Dany is her subject.&#8221;</p>
