			<p>A German Shepherd is being hailed as a hero. She saved his owner&#8217;s life after treading for 11 hours.</p>
<p>Heidi, a German Shepherd dog, is owned by a 63-year-old man from Brisbane, Australia. She is recognized as a hero after she saved her owner when his boat sank off the coast.</p>
<p>On 20th February, police officers in Moreton Bay, Australia were notified by a fisherman who had spotted Heidi swimming in the bay next to a tackle box, a wetsuit, and other things that might have fallen from the boat. This all pointed out to the possibility that the boater might be in trouble.</p>

<h2><strong>Heidi, the Hero German Shepherd</strong></h2>

<p>Heidi was immediately pulled out of the water and rushed to a veterinarian. In the meantime, Brisbane Water initiated a rescue operation to look for Heidi&#8217;s owner.</p>
<p>After a few hours, the German Shephard&#8217;s owner was found hanging onto a boat in Moreton Bay.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://abc7news.com/5956187/">ABC News</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The 63-year-old-man was rescued, and he told police that the boat lost power the evening before and began to take on water.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Everything&#8217;s out of harm&#8217;s way</h2>

<p>The police said, &#8220;Heidi, who was found to be uninjured by the vet, had “amazingly” been treading water for about eleven hours while she waited for help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her owner was taken to the hospital too. He didn&#8217;t have any serious injuries and was eventually discharged. Meanwhile, Heidi was pampered with some delicious food and had some good rest at Brisbane Water Police Station.</p>
<p>Heidi is known as an honorary police dog. Oh well, isn&#8217;t she deserving?</p>
<h2>A safety reminder</h2>
<p>Senior Sergeant Jay Bairstow of the Brisbane Water Police said, &#8220;We would take this opportunity to remind boaties to plan for the worst when they’re out on the water. Always wear a personal flotation device and ensure that your safety equipment is tested and in good order.”</p>
<p>Senior Sergeant Bairstow also added, “Thankfully there was a happy ending to this search and Heidi was able to be our honorary PD for the day.”</p>
<p>And finally, kudos to our little hero who persistently tried to save her owner.</p>
