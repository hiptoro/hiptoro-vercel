			<h2><strong>When Leah Tornabene sat down with her son to watch an episode of Live PD two years ago, she had no idea that the trajectory of their lives was about to change forever.</strong></h2>
<p>When the mother and son watched the drama unfold, the 8-year-old Brady Snakovsky noticed that there was something missing. All the handler were wearing protective gears but their K9 counterparts had to deal with the crime scene without any. This triggered the thought in this young boys mind to do something for them.</p>
<h2>Meet 10-year-old Brady Snakovsky</h2>

<h2>With the help and support of his mom, Brady started a GoFundMe page appealing to friends, families, and animal lovers alike in hopes to make a change.</h2>
<p>In a short span of time, the boy was able to buy the first four vests for the pooches and gave them to the Ohio state trooper police department.</p>

<h2>Soon the ‘Brady K9 fund’ was born, a non-profit organization committed to providing police K9s with the safety and protection they rightly deserve.</h2>

<p>Having raised over 315,000 dollars and supplying 300 dogs with vests, (even some military pooches serving in Afghanistan!) we are pleased to say that they are doing an amazing job. When Leah was asked about her son and this journey they have made so far, she said:</p>
<blockquote><p> I was quite surprised that a child at age eight could recognize that there was an issue and that he could find a solution to fix that problem. It made me very proud to see him doing this.</p></blockquote>

<p>Leah also wanted to draw attention to the fact that the police force has to depend on donation to look after their K9 units.</p>

<h2>How cool is that?!</h2>

<p>Brandon can’t wait to be a police officer. But at his age, and by considering all that he has done,  we believe that he is going to be a great officer someday.</p>

<h2>‘I like seeing the smile on the handler’s face,’ he said.</h2>
