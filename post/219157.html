			<p>As Bruce Willis&#8217; mental abilities continue to get worse, his family says they are &#8220;praying for a Christmas miracle&#8221; and &#8220;treasuring every moment&#8221; they have left with him.</p>
<p>Even though his current wife, Emma Heming, is doing her best to help him communicate, the legendary actor and his ex-wife, Demi Moore, have grown even closer in the months since the actor retired from a Hollywood career that lasted decades.</p>
<p>Willis&#8217;s family told the public in March that he had been diagnosed with aphasia, a disorder that makes it hard to speak and understand language. At the time, Willis was 67 years old.</p>
<p>Since then, his condition has gotten worse, according to a source close to the family. Now, his family is getting back together to spend as much time with him as they can.</p>
<blockquote><p>They know he won&#8217;t be around forever,</p></blockquote>
<p>the unnamed source said.</p>
<blockquote><p>So they&#8217;re cherishing every single moment.</p></blockquote>

<p>The source went on to say that Moore &#8220;has been in touch with Bruce and Emma all the time.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>She takes every opportunity she can to spend time with him,</p></blockquote>
<p>they said, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>If she&#8217;s not there by his side, she&#8217;s calling on the phone just so Bruce can hear her voice.</p></blockquote>
<p>As they do every year, the mixed-up family is spending the holidays together in Idaho. Tallulah, Willis and Moore&#8217;s 28-year-old daughter, recently posted a photo of her hugging her mother while her father looked at Demi&#8217;s dog, Pilaf.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was always a special time,</p></blockquote>
<p>the source said.</p>
<blockquote><p>The family traditions they loved continued, like their pajama parties and game nights.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also said that Demi and Emma have become closer because they are working together to help the actor, who is having trouble finding work.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bruce can&#8217;t say much, and it doesn&#8217;t seem like he&#8217;s grasping much of what others say. So Emma&#8217;s really been the voice and communicator for him.</p>
<p>There are days when they see glimpses of the old Bruce,&#8217; he noted, &#8216;but they are brief and far between.</p>
<p>It seems he&#8217;s slipping further away from them and it breaks their heart. The girls can&#8217;t imagine Christmas without Bruce.</p></blockquote>
<h6></h6>
<p>The anonymous source went on to say how hard it has been to &#8220;see him get worse,&#8221; adding,</p>
<blockquote><p>The older girls miss the old Bruce â€” the one who used to tease them about their boyfriends and give them unsolicited advice.</p></blockquote>
<p>After saying that, he added,</p>
<blockquote><p>all they can do is tell them they love him and pray for a holiday miracle.</p></blockquote>

<p>It looks like the actor&#8217;s happy family is making the most of the time they still have with him since his daughters, Tallulah and Scout, are sharing photos of the whole family.</p>
<p>Tallulah wrote about how much she loves her parents in this week&#8217;s blog post, and Scout showed pictures of Bruce lovingly holding Pilaf while he ate dinner with Tallulah and his wife, Emma.</p>
<blockquote><p>Family dinner night,</p></blockquote>
<p>she wrote in the photo.</p>
<p>In another picture, Bruce was holding Emma&#8217;s hand gently as they sat next to each other at the table.</p>
<p>Bruce and Emma got married in 2009, and since then, God has given them two daughters, Mabel and Evelyn.</p>
<p>Before Die Hard, the actor who played John McClane was married to Demi Moore from 1987 to 2000. They&#8217;ve been together long enough to have three beautiful daughters: Rumer, Tallulah, and Scout.</p>

<p>Bruce has been diagnosed with aphasia, which makes it hard for him to communicate. Earlier this year, his family told the public that he would be leaving the acting business.</p>
<blockquote><p>To Bruce&#8217;s amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities,</p></blockquote>
<p>they wrote.</p>
<blockquote><p>As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him. This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support.</p>
<p>We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him,</p></blockquote>
<p>they added.</p>
<blockquote><p>As Bruce always says, &#8216;Live it up&#8217; and together we plan to do just that.</p></blockquote>
