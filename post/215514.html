			<p>As the mother of three children, Julia Roberts knows that being a parent can sometimes be hard and take a lot of time. Even more so now, when all you have to do is turn on the TV, to be completely unprepared for anything that might show up on the screen. So, the beautiful Julia Roberts is here with us today to talk about the rules she follows as a parent and why she hasn&#8217;t been in movies for twenty years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The 20 happy years of marriage.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-215522" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/648fee5eafade12cb27735f56c.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="783" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/648fee5eafade12cb27735f56c.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/648fee5eafade12cb27735f56c-279x300.jpg 279w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Roberts met her future husband, actor Danny Moder, for the first time when they were both working on a movie set. The couple has been together for twenty years, and they are still madly in love with each other. Roberts told Gayle King that even though she has been married for 20 years, just thinking about her partner makes her feel like she has a nervous stomach.</p>

<p>Roberts told Oprah Winfrey this when they were talking about why she was so happy with her life and why she had finally reached a point where she was satisfied with it. “A huge part of it is my marriage. My husband, Danny, has really shined the light for me. Because of being married, I’ve met people and experienced all these little things that have nurtured my life — not so much changed it, just nurtured it in a way that’s astounding.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Roberts put a hold on her career to focus more on her family.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-215520" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/b9eb00508cb12aa6c726d26b64.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="874" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/b9eb00508cb12aa6c726d26b64.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/b9eb00508cb12aa6c726d26b64-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Roberts hasn&#8217;t been in any movies or TV shows in a long time, so none of us have seen her act. The actress said that before she could make a quick decision about whether or not to take on a new role, she had to think about not only her husband&#8217;s work schedule but also the schedules of their children. Even when their father wasn&#8217;t around, she made it her top priority to raise her children and always be there for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>She spoke about parenting.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-215519" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/80da865c89b1c20d73bc84c91b.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="818" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/80da865c89b1c20d73bc84c91b.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/80da865c89b1c20d73bc84c91b-267x300.jpg 267w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Julia Roberts doesn&#8217;t seem like the kind of mom who would sit back and let her kids do whatever they wanted. She has said that she is a strict parent, and she has said that she doesn&#8217;t let her three kids use social media and limits how much TV they can watch. “I try to keep them off social media because I don’t really understand what they need that for right now”, she <a href="https://her.womenworking.com/julia-roberts-motherhood-children-production-process-balancing-work-and-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">said</a>.</p>

<p>“I have a sense of great pride in being home with my family,” Roberts <a href="https://www.romper.com/entertainment/julia-roberts-homemaker-acting-kids-family" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">said</a>. Fox News says that Roberts is a strict mom. She doesn&#8217;t really lose her cool, but she thinks it&#8217;s important for kids to know where the lines are. “If something happens I don’t really punish them, I prefer to have conversations with them. I think my serious face is punishment enough,” she <a href="https://her.womenworking.com/julia-roberts-motherhood-children-production-process-balancing-work-and-children" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">added</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-215517" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/gettyimages-1199837037-612x612-1.jpg" alt="" width="408" height="612" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/gettyimages-1199837037-612x612-1.jpg 408w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/gettyimages-1199837037-612x612-1-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 408px) 100vw, 408px" /></p>
<p>One of the most important things for Roberts and Moder to do as parents are to make sure that their kids are never put in embarrassing situations. Roberts values the time she gets to spend alone with her kids, so she and her partner in the entertainment business chose to live in San Francisco instead of Los Angeles, which is much busier. “She wanted her children, who are growing up so fast, to have the experience of a city with a different energy and vibe,” a pal of the actress exclusively <a href="https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/julia-roberts-kids-a-guide-to-the-actress-family-with-danny-moder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">told</a> <i>Closer</i> in June 2020. “Her kids are not movie star kids in San Francisco, where no one cares who your mom is.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Her career and family.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-215516" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/115e305821b3761fed9042c9c7.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="910" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/115e305821b3761fed9042c9c7.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/115e305821b3761fed9042c9c7-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>In an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, Roberts talked about how she feels about her family and her acting career. She said that acting was &#8220;my dream come true,&#8221; but it wasn&#8217;t the only one. When asked what her other goals were, the Oscar winner pointed to her family and said she wanted them to share in her success. “She wanted her children, who are growing up so fast, to have the experience of a city with a different energy and vibe,” a pal of the actress exclusively <a href="https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/julia-roberts-kids-a-guide-to-the-actress-family-with-danny-moder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">told</a> <i>Closer</i> in June 2020. “Her kids are not movie star kids in San Francisco, where no one cares who your mom is.”</p>

<p>Roberts thinks it&#8217;s very important for her and her family to have a quiet, normal life, and she says she tries hard to find a balance between the two. Her kids have to do chores like making their beds and doing their own laundry on a regular basis because she thinks that these are &#8220;important life skills.&#8221;</p>
