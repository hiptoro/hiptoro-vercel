			<p>Our pets love us. They love us so much that they can’t let any other person come near us. This might sound a bit cheesy but this is true. And the amazing thing is that they are not afraid to show how much they love their favorite humans. Why would they? After all, they need our attention all the time.</p>
<p>There is actually nothing wrong is that. But sometimes, they get so jealous (so so jealous) that they end up stealing their owner&#8217;s girlfriend or boyfriend. Yep, you have read it right!</p>
<p>To show how shamelessly jealous pets can steal your significant other if you are not careful, we have found some cute pictures. So go on, check the pictures, and be careful!</p>
