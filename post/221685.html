			<p>Shania Twain is showing off how confident of herself she is.</p>
<p>When she posed shirtless for the cover of her new single, &#8220;Waking Up Dreaming,&#8221; the country-pop star didn&#8217;t leave much to the imagination.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is me expressing my truth. I&#8217;m comfortable in my own skin, and this is the way I am sharing that confidence,</p></blockquote>
<p>she said during an interview.</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the best fashion is confidence, and whatever you wear… if you&#8217;re wearing it with that, it&#8217;s fashionable. I am a woman in my late 50s, and I don&#8217;t need to hide behind the clothes. I can&#8217;t even tell you how good it felt to do nude shooting. I was just so unashamed of my new body… It&#8217;s really liberating.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the topless picture, the now-57-year-old singer is kneeling on the ground while wearing a white skirt and tie-dyed pink boots. Twain wore a white cowboy hat and posed with her arms in front of her body to finish off her look.</p>
<p>The song &#8220;Waking Up Dreaming&#8221; will be on her sixth studio album, &#8220;Queen of Me,&#8221; which will come out on February 3.</p>

<p>Even though she&#8217;s taken risks in her music career, Twain said she&#8217;s had problems with her body over the years.</p>

<p>In the 1993 music video for &#8220;What Made You Say That,&#8221; the singer took off her bra and showed off her midriff.</p>

<blockquote><p>From the very beginning… the very first video… I was ditching the bra,</p></blockquote>
<p>she admitted to the media outlet.</p>
<blockquote><p>But, I was a lot firmer then, so as I grew older, I started feeling a different pressure of, &#8216;Well, your breasts are not as plump as they used to be. Your skin is not as tight as it used to be. Maybe you should start covering it up a little bit more.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=221687" rel="attachment wp-att-221687"><img data-dominant-color="874684" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #874684;" decoding="async" class="not-transparent aligncenter size-full wp-image-221687" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Shania-Twain-performs-jpg.webp" alt="Shania Twain" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Shania-Twain-performs-jpg.webp 720w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Shania-Twain-performs-300x169.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></a></p>
<p>The singer of &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/ZJL4UGSbeFg">Man! I Feel Like a Woman</a>&#8221; has used her music to keep her self-confidence high.</p>
<p>Shania Twain said that any doubts she had about how she looked made her want to be brave in her next project.</p>
<blockquote><p>I hit this wall and was like, &#8216;Whoa, my confidence is regressing. My courage is dulling. Why am I allowing this? Frig that. I am not regressing. I am embracing my body as it changes, as I should have from my childhood to my teens, as I should be from my taut, 20s and 30-year-old self… I&#8217;m not going to be shy about it. I want to be courageous about it, and I want to share that courage in the artwork that I am directing,</p></blockquote>
<p>she said.</p>
