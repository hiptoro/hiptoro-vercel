<p>My boss tried to tell me I couldn&#8217;t get a surgery I&#8217;d been effectively waiting 5 or 6 years for. She was like &#8220;sorry &#8211; I&#8217;ve already got 3 people on annual leave for those weeks&#8221;. I basically said to her &#8220;prepare for a 4th &#8211; cause I&#8217;m either on annual leave or not coming back at all&#8221;.</p>
<p>Funniest part was &#8211; she was in the middle of being replaced by someone else &#8211; so I went to her replacement (who would be in charge about 3/4 days before my surgery) and she was aghast and was like &#8220;Of course you can have your surgery &#8211; we&#8217;ll make it work!&#8221; and that was it.</p>

My dog became very ill quite suddenly and he needed to be put down, I was at work and I asked to leave half an hour early so I could be there for him. I asked my manager and she got annoyed and said there was &#8220;no way&#8221; and that I should have told her earlier. I said &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t realize my dog was going to die&#8221; in the most sarcastic way possible then walked away knowing she&#8217;d follow me, I then stood at my desk and typed my resignation up infront of her.</p>
<p>She gave me the time off.</p>
<p>No one was going to stop me from being there for my boy.</p>

I was 16 and my Step-Dad was in hospital around 5hrs away dying from cancer. I got a phone call at work for about the third time in a couple of months that I needed to get down there ASAP to say my goodbyes, as this could be it. My bosses were all well aware of the situation, one of them was even friends with my Step-Dad. When I rushed out the back to tell them I had to go, this bloke looks at me, a crying, frightened,16yr old girl, and told me I had to stop doing this, and get my priorities right. In a rare showing of assertiveness I looked that d***snap in the eye and told him he was right, and quit on the spot.</p>

My wife was attacked, was in surgery when I got called about it. I was less than 10 miles away. Got told: Finish the run (9 hours), then go see her, you can&#8217;t help her anyway.</p>
<p>Parked a Semi/trailer in the back lot of the hospital, told them to page me for the keys.</p>

We had a manager that was a prick. It was a sales role and he had no empathy when our sales were flat. He’s get very abusive and threatening.</p>
<p>One day, he was shouting at us and my colleague got pissed off. He was explaining it was one bad week off the back of seven good weeks. You got to expect ups and downs with sales.</p>
<p>The manager just yells louder claiming my colleague is a ‘quitter’ and doesn’t have a winners mindset.</p>
<p>Colleague tells him ‘I’ve had enough of this sh**. I’m done’</p>
<p>Manager screams ‘I want your resignation in writing.</p>
<p>Colleague scribbles a note and gives it to him. Manager had a [bad] reputation and couldn’t recruit. Our sales were even lower with one less person on the team. It ruined his career.</p>
<p>But funnier than that was the short, but sweet resignation note from my colleague. It read…</p>
<p>“Dear Bob. I’m off. F**k you”.</p>

I was a teacher. I had confided in the school principal that I was struggling with depression but getting treatment. This a-hole (who also happened to be a deacon at my church) proceeds to tell me that depression is a spiritual problem that I needed to solve. I was too shocked and upset to say much of anything then, but I wrote him a letter telling him what I thought of his actions and his “Christianity.” Ultimately cost me my job, but damn it was satisfying and I don’t regret it in the least.</p>

I was working at NTW (National Tire warehouse) before it was national tire and battery, and my first day I was scheduled for a 14 hour shift for some reason. About 6 hours into it, I asked my manager when out break time was. He said “what do you mean by break?” I said “a half hour break as mandated by law, and two 15 minute breaks required on top of that, also required by law.” His response was “most people don’t take those here, we have costumers to take care of”</p>
<p>After that, I clocked out and went to Wendy’s to get lunch. I figured f**k these a-holes, go ahead and fire me.</p>
<p>After lunch, I was doing a tire rotation and balance, the manager came out and told me not to balance the back tires if the costumer isn’t watching me. That was the nail in the coffin for me. They paid for that.</p>
<p>I got to talking with some of the longtime employees and they informed me that the sales counter guys (our managers) made commission from every sale and got bonuses every month while we got our minimum wage and raises were rare. I finished my shift and clocked out. Went looking for a new job the next day. Any company like that can go piss off.</p>
<p>So when you go get your tires balanced, watch them.</p>

All at the same hotel, all different bosses.</p>
<p>When I refused to put caffeinated coffee beans in the decaf hopper for a &#8220;loyalty member&#8221; and my new boss insisted I do it because &#8220;you will do as the men (meaning he and the guest) have told you, girl&#8221;.</p>
<p>When I refused to forge signatures of other people on tax documents.</p>
<p>When a boss insisted I deliver a guests room service, because the guest insisted a female deliver it despite knowing the man had previously tried to drag a housekeeper into his room.</p>
<p>When my chefs insisted I serve a meat dish as &#8220;vegetarian&#8221; because they accidentally cooked the wrong thing and didn&#8217;t want to fix something else.</p>
<p>A child, probably 12-14, called down to ask for Tylenol for her headache. Her mom wasn&#8217;t in the room but confirmed it was okay. I had met the kid earlier and noticed several self harm scars. then later I noticed the kid was wearing a heavy long sleeve jacket in the middle of 103° weather and she just seemed off. I went to deliver the medicine. The lights in the room were dark but I thought her sweater sleeves were either stained or magically dip dyed so I held the packet out far enough she had to reach into the hall and her sleeves were wet with blood. My entire leadership team insisted I not &#8220;get involved&#8221;, that no one in the hotel would do anything, and even insisted I leave the hotel with full pay so I couldn&#8217;t. I left, realized I still had the mom&#8217;s number from asking about the Tylenol, called the police and gave them the room and mom&#8217;s number and spent the rest of my shift terrified for the poor girl.</p>

My brother and sister in law just lost their son. At birth. They lived down south and I live on west coast. HR said FMLA doesn’t cover sibling emergencies. Just parents and grandparents. I was also two weeks from being off my new hire probation period. I had pto but because I was still in probation period, I couldn’t access it. I told my supervisor I’m leaving for such amount of days and will accept whatever consequences when I get home. I can’t care about that right now.</p>
<p>And I left to be with family . . . Fortunately my supervisor went to bat for me and I got to keep my job</p>

My boss once told me that I have to come in to the office the next day, which was a PUBLIC HOLIDAY, because we needed to clear out the office storage unit. He said that we can&#8217;t afford to take time out of work days for that task.</p>
<p>So I begrudgingly agreed and showed up the next day. When I opened the storage unit it was crammed full of stuff&#8230; full of the boss&#8217;s PERSONAL STUFF. I&#8217;m talking boxes full of his old clothes, childhood toys, school projects and textbooks, gardening tools, furniture, sport and gym equipment, construction materials, paintings, etc. TVs.</p>
<p>I was so mad that I quit on the spot.</p>

I was working as a software developer and providing second line support, in the hospitality/conferencing industry. I had overheard a colleague trying to provide support for something that was clearly the client IT team’s fault. Later got a call from the client’s MD’s secretary wanting to set up a call with our founder to complain that the problem wasn’t being dealt with. I said “I can’t call him, I’m really sorry, please don’t ask me why. I know our support people are working on it.” Why couldn’t I call the founder? Because his wife had, that day, lost a full term baby &#8211; which I obviously couldn’t disclose. Soon after I got a furious call from the client MD himself. His IT team was obviously lying to him about our not returning calls &#8211; I had heard the calls being returned. And he just wouldn’t accept that I couldn’t call the founder and couldn’t tell him why. So eventually I just hung up on him.</p>
<p>I told the most senior person around, expecting to be fired on the spot for hanging up on a client. Her reaction: “Oh yeah, he’s not a nice guy: he’s physically attacked me in the past.” Not the outcome I was expecting!</p>

I was 17 and working part-time at a fast food restaurant. Someone wrecked the men’s restroom. S**t in the urinal, rubbed s**t all over the wall. The manager came out and told me to clean it. I refused. She threatened to fire me, to which I laughed in her face and told her “you can clean it yourself or you can lose an employee and still clean it yourself. I don’t need this job.”</p>
<p>Needless to say, I wasn’t fired and I didn’t clean that up. I still laugh thinking about it.</p>

Had a boss who told me I had three days to get a project done. Said project consisted of building 180 displays on pallets. Each display took 40 minutes to build. Doing the math it would have taken five days if I didn’t take any breaks or sleep or eat.</p>
<p>So I told him and explained it was impossible and he responded that I was making excuses. At that moment I didn’t care if he fired me or not.</p>

My job was micromanaging the hell out of everyone. They had 3 different softwares that tracked where you were, speed, how much time you were on 1 job for, etc. On my way to get supplies for a job I came across an accident. No one had arrived yet so I pulled over and helped a trapped woman out of her car and tried to calm her and take care of stuff until Medics arrive. I text my boss very quickly that I&#8217;m at the scene of a major accident rendering aid and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m stopped. I was told by boss A to not spend too much time there, as I am on the clock. I ignore him. After medics take over, I take a video of the scene as I leave to prove that there was a bad accident. I was fired for taking the video because it was taken from in the company truck. When they fired me, I smiled. There are 8 people that company in the position I was in. The 2 most experienced quit after that. The others are applying for new jobs.</p>

My Dad just had a heart attack the night before so I came in that morning to tell my Boss what happened. (I had something to give back to a colleague that&#8217;s why I didn&#8217;t do it on the phone) This was inventory day at Costco, the day that everyone had to work. All Directors, assistant directors, Supervisors&#8230; had to be there too.</p>
<p>The Assistant Director told me he would see what he could do for me. This is when I told him: &#8220;I&#8217;m not asking for permission, I&#8217;m telling you I&#8217;m leaving.&#8221; And I left.</p>
<p>I worked there for a couple of miserable years after that.</p>

When I was ordered to carry a 250kg kitchen board into a house.</p>
<p>We had special carts for that but due to lack of maintenance ours had 2 flat tires, we called the boss about it and he ordered us to lift it ourselves, 250kg, 2 people, he even acted surprised that we called first and didn&#8217;t just carry it immediately.</p>
