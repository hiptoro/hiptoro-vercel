			<p>About 20 years ago, Mike Moffitt had a flip phone. He heard a woman&#8217;s voice when he answered it.</p>
<p>Gladys lives in Florida. She mixed up the area codes while trying to call her sister. Instead of calling Maryland, she called Rhode Island. Mike decided to have a conversation after she called and hung up a few times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike said, “Finally I just grabbed it and said, ‘Wait wait wait, before you go, who are you, where are you from, what are you trying to do? And we started talking.”</p>
<p>Gladys was having a hard time lately. She had just gotten divorced and one of her sons had died.</p>
<p>She mentioned, “I said my son passed away and he said I’m so sorry and he talked real nice to me and I talked real nice to him, and after that, I had his phone number and I put it down on paper and I always called him.”</p>
<p>For the next 20 years, Mike and Gladys exchanged phone calls. They became close to each other. Mike was told by Gladys&#8217;s son that someone close to her had died.</p>
<p>“He was like, ‘My mom just wanted me to call and let you know,&#8217;” Mike remembered. “All of a sudden [our relationship] became not like a superficial check-in call … I understood what it meant to her.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The visit.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mike said, “I just walked in and I said, ‘I’m Mike from Rhode Island,’ and she just threw her hands up and said ‘I’m blessed.’”</p>
<p>The two friends cherished the short visit. Gladys mentioned it was “the happiest Thanksgiving there was.” She said she wished more people would reach out and be friendly to a stranger like Mike did.</p>
<p>“That would be so nice, the world would be better too, people would be better,” she said.</p>

<p>Mike wrote in the picture post on Facebook, “There are incredible people in this world that are a wrong number phone call away.” It&#8217;s a very good reminder to us all.</p>
