<p>Saw this one on a medical sub awhile back:</p>
<p>This woman has just given birth and tore a bit, and the father was in the delivery room while the nurse stitched her up.</p>
<p>The father “jokingly” said, “Be sure and stitch her up nice and tight for me down there m lol”</p>
<p>Without missing a beat the nurse said, “Just how small do you need it to be, sir?!”</p>
<p>She was a legend on the floor for that lol</p>

My dad and I were at a farming expo. I have a bunch of chickens. This presenter, a chicken-owning expert, is droning on about how stupid chickens are, and I&#8217;m getting annoyed. I know they&#8217;re not clever, but you can teach them basic tricks. And even if they are stupid, okay, fine, but I came here to learn something, please.</p>
<p>My dad, without missing a beat, after this woman says they&#8217;re dumb for the fourth time: &#8220;I think chickens take on the personalities of their owners.&#8221;</p>

My friend got pantsed, underwear and all at a party. Instead of pulling his underwear and pants up, immediately, he just kept going about his business, while hanging dong. Those of us that knew him already thought it was hilarious. The people at the party that didn&#8217;t know him, looked really uncomfortable due to this dude having his pants and underwear around his ankles, with his wiener hanging freely. Our friend/the host said &#8220;dude, why don&#8217;t you pull your pants up?&#8221; Pantsed guy said &#8220;I didn&#8217;t pull them down.&#8221; Then took his turn in beer pong. The host then found the guy that did pull them down and made him pull our friend&#8217;s pants back up.</p>

My son and his newlywed wife were poor college students living out of state. When I went to visit them I took them to the grocery store and let them fill up a couple of grocery carts that I paid for. As we were leaving the store I said, &#8220;Now, when your kids are poor married college students trying to get by, don&#8217;t forget this&#8221;. My new daughter-in-law piped up and said, &#8220;Oh we won&#8217;t forget. We&#8217;re going to tell them to go get grandpa!&#8221; Haa haaa haaa&#8230;I love that gal.</p>

My 3 year old niece came over with her dad, and, as little kids do, just randomly interrupted our adult conversation to say emphatically: I’m THREE!</p>
<p>Me: Wow, sweetie! How did you get so old??</p>
<p>Niece, gently but matter-of-factly correcting me like I am a simpleton who needs help: Actually, I’m kind of new.</p>
<p>It’s been months and I laugh every time I think of this story.</p>

I used the line from the movie Iron Eagle once on a bully at school that actually seemed to help. Using the kids name when he shoved me against some lockers I said so everyone in the hallway could hear:</p>
<p>“What’s your problem, Rory? Can’t you get through a single day without proving what an as**ole you are?”</p>
<p>He stammered and shrugged and walked always and never really bothered me again.</p>

I used to work with a very conservative, very angry older man who would get triggered if you did not agree with him. Like red face angry. He would always equate my age to being less intelligent than him. I forget what we were talking about . But he went on about how he was wiser given his age. I simply said if you’re so smart then why the hell are we both doing the same job? He did not have an answer for me. And then I felt bad afterwards for having said it.</p>

Regrettably, a secondhand telling. One of my favorite bars in Chicago (Galway Bay) has several Irish bartenders, and gets its fair share of tourists. At the earliest hint of an Irish accent, this particular tourist can&#8217;t resist&#8230; &#8220;I&#8217;ve been to Ireland. Amazing place. What part of Ireland are you from?&#8221;</p>
<p>Bartender &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m from (wherever), but I&#8217;ve moved around a bit&#8221;</p>
<p>Tourist &#8211; &#8220;My great grandfather was from (somewhere place unrelated to bartender&#8217;s hometown). He was a farrier. Do you know what a farrier is?&#8221;</p>
<p>B &#8211; &#8220;Aye, they shoe horses&#8221; [a bit agitated at the dull conversation]</p>
<p>T &#8211; &#8220;Have you ever shoed a horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>B &#8211; &#8220;Never shooed a horse, but I&#8217;ve told a donkey to f**k off once.&#8221;</p>

I asked my mum out of curiosity what she would do if she found a used condom in my brother&#8217;s room.</p>
<p>Her response: &#8220;I would remind him that you can&#8217;t get HIV from your own hand&#8221;</p>
<p>For context, I live in South Africa where HIV is very common</p>

I worked with an older gentleman who was from Chicago. He had a story or an opinion on everything and he was very proud of his smack talking talents.</p>
<p>The entire department was walking off to a meeting and, as it was summer and many of us were wearing shorts, somehow the topic shifted to the lack of hair on somebody&#8217;s legs. Mr Smack Talker spouted out the comment that &#8220;hair don&#8217;t grow on dead things.&#8221; All I had to do was look at his head and arch an eyebrow. He had let the fact that he was quite bald escape his memory.</p>

Somewhere on this planet, there is a tree that has spent it&#8217;s entire life creating the oxygen you breathe. You should find that tree and apologize.</p>
