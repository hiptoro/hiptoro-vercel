<p>“A veterinary ophthalmologist examined him thoroughly, cured him, and deemed him irreparable because he only has about 10% of his vision and he couldn’t survive in the wild on his own.”</p>

<p>“It’s so camouflaged that most people don’t notice it until we point it out. Many other people see it but think it is a stuffed animal because it is so calm and peaceful. When you wake up and open your eyes, people are shocked. We have had people almost cry when he reveals his beautiful eyes. ”</p>
