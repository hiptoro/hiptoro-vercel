			<p>There have been a lot of great movies made, and many of them feature characters who are so well-known that they will be remembered for many years to come. Some of these are extremely well-known all over the world and are an indelible part of popular culture in this day and age. It is impossible to overlook the significant contributions that have been made by the incredible acting talent, make-up artists, costume designers, and editors who have been essential in bringing these characters to life.</p>
<p>The incredible edits that you are about to view were created by Angela Norris, who is also the owner of Fxattics Studios. Norris has shown us the incredible transformations that are required to bring these characters to life by placing the human actors right next to the most iconic characters they have played in their careers. You will be completely astounded by the contrast between the two when you look at them side by side.</p>
<p>Angela discusses the inspiration behind the creation of these altered photographs in her own words: “I am the owner of Fxattics Studios, where I make props and Halloween masks, so I’m always trying to create works of art to increase my likes and views on the page. I had the idea to do the montage with the clown Twisty as many people don’t know that he is John Carroll Lynch from the show Drew Carey. My followers liked the idea and I kept doing it.” Regardless of the reasons why she came up with this idea, there is consensus among us that it is very creative and fascinating. Let&#8217;s not waste any more time and take a look at these pictures for ourselves right away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Michael Myers And Tony Moran From “Halloween”</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211614" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Michael-Myers.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="471" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Michael-Myers.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Michael-Myers-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>San And Quinn Lord From “Trick ‘R Treat”</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211613" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Quinn-Lorde.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="461" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Quinn-Lorde.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Quinn-Lorde-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Freddy Krueger And Robert Englund From “A Nightmare On Elm Street”</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211612" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Robert-Englund.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="876" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Robert-Englund.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Robert-Englund-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Angela, the following served as her motivation for working on this project: “I am a huge John Carroll Lynch fan and he portrays Twisty the clown of American Horror Story. So many people did not know that that was him. So, I decided to make a bunch of art pieces of horror Icons and the actors who portray them. A behind the mask and makeup, if you will.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Captain Spaulding And Sid Haig From “House Of 1000 Corpses”</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211611" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sid-Haig.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="581" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sid-Haig.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sid-Haig-300x249.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Those eyebrows were unquestionably the result of a great deal of effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Clown And David Howard Thornton From The Film “Terrifier”</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211610" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Terrifier.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="362" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Terrifier.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Terrifier-300x155.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following is what Angela says: “The goal was to generate some followers for my business page. I try to make things that I like and what interests me because I know so many people love horror out there as much as I do.”</p>
<p>Angela was solely responsible for the entirety of this project, from inception to completion. She took only a few days to complete this project, despite the fact that she chose the eeriest and most elaborate characters from various films and television shows. That right there is talent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Valak And Bonnie Aarons From “The Nun”</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211609" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Nun.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="613" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Nun.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Nun-300x263.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Samara And Daveigh Chase From “The Ring”</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211608" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Ring.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="576" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Ring.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Ring-300x247.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Angela shares some details of her life with us: “I was born in Salem, Massachusetts, so you could say horror is in my blood. I have been in love with horror and monsters since I was 4 years old, at which time I accidentally watched A Nightmare on Elm Street with my brother Ken. My husband Alan and I run Fxattics Studios. I run the artistic side and he runs the business and marketing. I got the better end of the deal, if I do say so myself. We have two children, Abigail, who is 10, and Adam, who is 14. They are often used as models and in our promotional videos. The apple didn’t fall far, that’s for sure. All the magic happens in Brooklyn, Michigan, which is where Fxattics Studios is located.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Lord Of Darkness, Pennywise And Frank N. Furter By Tim Curry From “Legend,” “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” And “It”</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211607" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tim-Curry.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="469" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tim-Curry.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tim-Curry-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pennywise And Bill Skarsgård From “It”</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211606" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bill-Skarsgard.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="481" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bill-Skarsgard.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bill-Skarsgard-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>“Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to make monsters. Rick Baker, Tom Savini, and Ve Neil were my superheroes. The transformation scene in An American Werewolf in London—a thing of beauty. I was hooked. Sculpting and creating is a dream. I have sold masks to almost every continent. Hundreds worldwide. Each one handmade by us. Seeing the joy our masks have brought to people makes everything we do worth it. There’s something about being the bump in the night on Halloween that fuels us.”</p>
<p>These are, without a doubt, some insanely transformative examples. The amount of talent, time, and make-up touch-ups that these actors would have to put up with throughout the production of the entire movie honestly leaves me in a state of complete and utter awe. Respect to them in all honesty! How much patience is required for this, not just from the actors but from everyone on the team?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Chucky And Brad Dourif From “Child’s Play”</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211605" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Childs-Play.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="702" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Childs-Play.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Childs-Play-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Childs-Play-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Childs-Play-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Angela takes it a step further: “What I love about horror is that it creates feelings much like being in love. The feeling of being scared and not knowing what’s coming next is so stimulating. Obviously, on the fictional level. I fell in love with my husband while watching horror movies. He had not seen many when we met. Still brings us together now.  We scare each other all the time. Even the kids will hide for minutes on end for the perfect scare.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we teach and preach that real monsters do not wear masks. We love what we do and know that the horror genre isn’t for everyone. For those like us who love it, we try to create content that stimulates, gets that blood pumping.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Jason Voorhees And Kane Hodder From “Friday The 13th”</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211603" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Friday-the-13th.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="410" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Friday-the-13th.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Friday-the-13th-300x176.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>

<p>The mere sight of that grin is enough to give us nightmares.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Creeper And Jonathan Breck From “Jeepers Creepers”</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211600" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jonathan-Breck.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="515" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jonathan-Breck.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jonathan-Breck-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>“That’s what it’s all about. My mom and dad told me I could be anything I wanted when I grew up, even when I told them I wanted to make scary monsters and masks. I am proof that you can make dreams come true if you are willing to do the hard work to get there. We scare because we care.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Predator And Big Foot By, Kevin Peter Hall From “The Predator” And “Harry And The Hendersons”</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congratulations go out to the whole team for these incredible improvements!
