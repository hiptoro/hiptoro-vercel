			<p>Professional wrestlers seem to die before the age of 55 than any other athlete. The abuse of their bodies, steroids, hard drugs, partying, long hours, and ultimately their deaths, are what end these hulking of the squared circle. Many of the greatest wrestlers of all time are not included. It&#8217;s almost like an occupational hazard to be a pro wrestler, considering all the bumps you get in the ring. As the sport of wrestling has grown in popularity and become a global brand of entertainment, the deaths of these wrestling giants have become more frequent. Many of the stars on this list have competed in professional wrestling. The men and women on this list have worked in some of the biggest arenas and pay-per-view events in the world.</p>
<p>So which wrestlers died young? That&#8217;s the shame of this list. There are guys like Owen Hart, who died during an in-ring stunt, or the tragedy of Chris Benoit and his family, which words can&#8217;t really do justice. Others, like Andre The Giant was a victim of his own size and ultimately that size was one of the reasons for his great success.</p>
<p>The wrestlers died before their 55th birthday. Take a look at the list of dead wrestlers and see who died young.</p>
