			<p>Social media trolling has undoubtedly increased so much. It&#8217;s just that people can&#8217;t mind their own business. And they are always ready to poke others no matter how morally corrupted they themselves are.</p>
<p>But the good thing is that people who are getting trolled are in no mode to take this bullshit. Like this North Carolina-based musician and singer, named Joyner. She took a stand and gave a fitting reply to her troller.</p>

<h2>TikToker Zaria Joyner recently responded to a troll questioning her Metallica fandom by busting out a guitar and actually playing some Metallica songs, which is so f***ing metal.</h2>
<p>What happened was that she posted different videos on her account wearing various Metallica T-shirts. And this is where the problem started. Since she was wearing such a T-shirt, a user <em>paytonnsmith</em>, thought of trolling her by being clever because girls don&#8217;t normally like Metallica. He asked her to “Name 3 Metallica songs.”</p>

<h3>Well, Joyner, 21, <a href="https://ruinmyweek.com/entertainment/33-of-the-most-savage-celebrity-clap-backs-in-internet-history/">had the best response</a>. Instead of just naming three Metallica songs, she pulled out her guitar and started shredding “Master of Puppets,” “Enter Sandman,” and the guitar lead in “One.”</h3>

<h2>Now, Joyner is “taking requests I guess.” And the paytonnsmith account has been deleted or made private. Joyner says it might be from “all of the people tagging him and denouncing the comment.”</h2>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">“I really just thought it would be funny and I didn’t expect the response that the video received,” Joyner said. She also adds that “the supportive comments just kept rolling in.”</p>
