			<p>American rapper and singer-songwriter Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar is better known by her stage name, &#8220;Cardi B.&#8221; Her aggressive flow and honest lyrics make her well-known.</p>
<p>As an influencer, she became known first on sites like Vine and Instagram. Cardi was on the VH1 reality show Love &amp; Hip Hop: New York from 2015 to 2017. After that, she went on to become a professional rapper and has since put out a number of songs that have become hits.</p>
<p>Some of her most popular songs are &#8220;Shake It,&#8221; &#8220;Bodak Yellow,&#8221; &#8220;Money,&#8221; &#8220;I Like It,&#8221; &#8220;Hot Shit,&#8221; and &#8220;Thru Your Phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to her music, the thirty-year-old songwriter is known for how much she loves her family and children. Everyone knows B, and everyone knows that she loves kids and puts her family above everything else.</p>
<p>The American rapper Offset is married to the singer from WAP. She dated Kiari Kendrell Cephus, better known as Offset, for more than a year before they got married in September 2017. The couple has two children: a 4-year-old daughter named Kulture and a 1-year-old son named Wave.</p>

<p>The American rapper also has three children from previous relationships. He has a seven-year-old daughter named Kalea and two sons named Kody and Jordan.</p>
<p>In an interview with Essence Magazine in April 2022, the star of Bad and Boujee said that Cardi B is a loving mother to his three children from previous relationships and that she loves Kalea, Kody, and Jordan just as much as she does Kulture and Wave.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a blessing to be able to have them all together, and to have a wife who’s open and treats them as if they’re her kids,</p></blockquote>
<p>he said.</p>
<blockquote><p>It could be an issue, but I don’t have to go through that, and that’s beautiful.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the past few weeks, the musician has also been in the news because of how hard it has been for her to make her husband, Offset, happy after his cousin and bandmate Takeoff died in November.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old man was shot and killed in Houston, Texas, on November 1, 2022.</p>
<p>The Rodeo singer recently criticized Casey Anthony by calling her &#8220;America&#8217;s most hated mom&#8221; and a &#8220;disgrace of a mother&#8221; on social media.</p>
<p>After the controversial documentary Casey Anthony: Where the Truth Lies, which was directed by Peacock, came out, Cardi B posted her tweet in response to it.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t give a deum how they flip it, switch it, turn it, toss it Casey Anthony is a disgrace of a mother, and she shouldn’t have a uterus. I don’t feel bad for her or for the daddy YALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENED to that baby!!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>she wrote on 6th December on Twitter.</p>

<p>Casey Anthony was already one of the most hated people in America when she was accused of killing her two-year-old daughter Caylee in 2008.</p>
<p>In the middle of 2008, the girl was reported missing, and six months later, her bones were found in the woods near the house where her family lived.</p>
<p>Casey, Caylee&#8217;s mom, was taken into custody and charged with killing her daughter. After a six-week trial, the jury decided that the woman was not guilty of the first-degree murder, aggregated child abuse, or aggravated manslaughter of a child charge that had been brought against her.</p>
<p>The person, who was 25 at the time, was found guilty of giving false information to law enforcement on four separate occasions and given a total of four years in prison, one year for each count.</p>
<p>Even though Casey wasn&#8217;t found guilty of the crime, she is still hated by thousands of people all over the world.</p>
<p>People on Twitter had a lot of different things to say about Cardi B&#8217;s tweet. Some people asked her why she was suddenly so angry about an old case, and many others asked Cardi to speak out against the luxury fashion house Balenciaga as well.</p>
<p>Even though this was true, most people still strongly agreed with the rapper and said that the slandered mother was awful.</p>
<blockquote><p>FACTS!! I watched every single day of that trial, and poor excuse for a mother is despicable, and should be in jail! They fumbled that case on purpose if you ask me,</p></blockquote>
