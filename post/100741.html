			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we go on a vacation, all we want is a comfortable and great accommodation so that we can spend some relaxing time. But something cosy rooms are not enough. And why should it be? After all, we like it when we get something more than we have paid for. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, there are people who are lucky enough to get more. And by more, we mean four-legged angels wrapped in fur. Sounds great, right? Of course! But what is even amazing is the pictures that people have shared on the Internet where they were greeted by pets during their stay in an Airbnb apartment. And the best thing- the pets provide their guests with the most amazing hospitality services like wet greetings on arrival, late-night cuddle, guarding the property, ear licking, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To fill your day with joy and happiness, we have found some great pictures of 4 legged hosts with their guests. Scroll down to see the super cute unofficial Airbnb super hosts.</span></p>
