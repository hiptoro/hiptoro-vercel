			<p>Dogs are the best creatures to have in your life. Not only are they loyal to you until the very end but they also fill your lives with love, laughter and good health. Many therapists also believe that having a dogs helps you come out of depressions and stress. Well, if you are not as fond of them as we are, we get it.</p>
<p>Last week, French artist Lucille aka Notidee tweeted a comic titled “It’s just a dog”, to address everyone who treats them as a pet and not an important member in her life. These comics illustrate the close bond that Notidee and her pet have with one another.</p>

<p>The artist has worked independently for all her projects. She has closely worked alongside animals in her life and life to illustrate her experiences in the form of comics.</p>
<p>“I work on many fronts artistically speaking, and am currently putting most of my energy into an upcoming visual novel called [Kernel],” she told Hiptoro</p>

<p>“Neos is a five years old Japanese Spitz who single-handedly shattered my world when he got here,” Notidee said. “He came to me at three months old [with health and reactivity issues], forcing me to relearn everything I thought I knew about dogs from the ground up.”</p>

<p>“Reactivity and resource guarding can put both owner and pet in danger if worked on without the help of a professional behaviorist,” Notidee said. „When working on reactivity, we usually focus on applied behavior analysis which, to make it really short and simple, is about giving choice to our dogs while desensitizing them progressively, without ever triggering a reaction (thus never needing any command, we prioritize fun games for the dog that we use to avoid triggers when we meet them outside).”</p>

<p>“I started studying animal behavior (medical training and behavior analysis and modification in particular) to improve his quality of life and give him the ability to make choices whenever possible,” Notidee explained. “He is now a healthy, well-adjusted pup. As for me, I’ve discovered another field I’m deeply passionate in alongside art.”</p>

Notidee said the attention her comic has received was overwhelming. “I have been flooded with messages from pet owners around the world telling me about the animals they share their lives with and how this comic conveyed the way they felt about their dogs, cats, birds, and other critters.”<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-143585 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/11-143.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="990" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/11-143.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/11-143-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>

<p>“Dedicated pet owners, and in particular those tending for the needs of reactive or more fragile animals, will usually puzzle their entourage by the amount of work, money and time they will put into making life a little easier for their pets,” Notidee said. “I had the hope that this comic could help build a bridge between Neos and I, and the people around us who struggle to understand us, but didn’t think the message would resonate with so many.”</p>
