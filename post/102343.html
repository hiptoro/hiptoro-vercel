			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are both good and bad things about shelter houses. Good thing is that so many super cute and adorable puppies get adopted. And they get a super amazing and loving family forever. But on the other hand, there are several senior dogs who are never adopted. This is because some of them have health problems and some get rejected because of their age. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The worst thing about this is that the senior dogs even die at the same shelter house waiting for a loving family. We know it&#8217;s sad. No matter what their age is, they surely deserve a caring house because, from their heart, they are still cute babies who can make anyone fall in love with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, there are people who came forward and gave a home to these babies who want nothing but love in their golden days. Scroll down to see their lovely pictures.</span></p>

<p>“We decided that the best way to honor Noah would be to help another dog, so we stopped at a shelter yesterday and adopted this handsome guy. Please welcome Jake to the Retired Retrievers family. Jake is 11 years old and was surrendered to the shelter by his owners, who said they didn’t have enough time or money to care for him anymore and he was living alone in the backyard. Now he is living in an RV (and seems pretty happy about it!) and he is going to continue the RV journey that Noah and Snappah started. We’ve known Jake for almost 24 hours now and he seems like a very sweet and smart boy. We look forward to updating you on his adventures as he heads off to see the world! Welcome to the family, Jake.”</p>

<p>“Well, this just made our day! A really nice couple reached out to us a few weeks ago after hearing about Retired Retrievers from Sara at Canine Palace and from Dr. Hill at Central Animal Hospital. Bill and Lisa recently lost one of their two black labs to cancer very suddenly and they wanted to open up their hearts and home to another senior who needed them. At the time, we didn’t have any dogs who quite matched what they were looking for, so we reached out to our friends at Great Dawg Rescue to see if they did. On Friday, Laura from Great Dawg sent us a Craigslist ad for an 11-year old black lab named Miley whose dad had passed away. Miley was being cared for by a family member but needed a new forever home. We called Bill and Lisa right away, not knowing if they would be interested because Miley was located a few hours away in Florida. But we also let them know that the kind folks at Great Dawg had offered to go meet Miley for them and even help with transport. Within a few hours, however, Bill and Lisa were already making plans to drive down to Florida on Sunday night with their dog, Jake, so they could all meet Miley this morning. We are happy to report that it was love at first sight for everyone and Miley now has a forever home in Savannah. On the drive home today they stopped to see the ocean and to eat at a dog-friendly cafe in Fernandina Beach. We have a feeling that Miley has already realized just how great her new parents are. Thanks to Bill and Lisa for having such huge hearts, and to Sara, Dr. Hill, Laura, and Jessica for all helping to make this happy ending possible. What a great way to start the week!”</p>
<h2>This Is My Recently Adopted Senior Dog Dingo (Around 9 Years Old). His Hobbies Include Watching Tv And Pretending To Be A Table</h2>

<h2>Miss Vergina the 11-year-old rescued senior dog.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102383 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/40-1.jpg" alt="" width="605" height="605" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s the story of an 11-year-old Brownie whose life changed after the flood. After this incident, her former family was not able to provide her what she deserves. Also, she lived on a chain in the backyard of the house. We know it’s too sad. But the best thing is someone called at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Greenbrier Humane Society and asked them to give shelter to one of the dogs who is stuck in the backyard. Hopefully, the volunteers came and now Brownie is living in a nice house. Her new family says that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She is an absolute doll!! She is gentle, smart, and loving. She only barks when it’s feeding time and I’m a little too slow for her!! She is so gentle with everyone she meets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have renamed her Miss Virginia, Ginny for short. She is starting to get the hang of her new name and her new routine. She loves to take a nap immediately after breakfast!! She can be stubborn when she doesn’t want to go outside or for a walk or get out of bed—she’ll just roll over and asks for a belly rub instead. The only time this was a hardship is when she would not finish her walk and we were about 3 blocks from home. I ended up carrying her the rest of the way!! She and Charlie (pictured in the napping shot) are starting to very slowly play together. They have been like two peas in a pod and have gotten along beautifully since the first moment they met. We could not be any luckier. Ginny also is awesome with cats. Although, I do think that she likes them way more than they like her. HAHA!! I would like to highlight how positive this whole experience has been for our sweet, sweet Charlie. He has regained his confidence and doesn’t get stressed when I’m getting ready to leave the house. (He used to shake like a leaf while I was getting dressed). This whole experience, while not seamless, has been tremendous for our whole family. My nephew, Jack, who can be a little shy around dogs, calls Ginny ‘Sweet Ginny’ and it just broke my heart to see how gentle she was with him. Senior dogs rock!”</span></p>

<p>“The big reveal…! Foster dog Gilbert got ADOPTED!!  Last week, Gilbert first met his new mom and dad, Nellissa and Noel, and a 10-year-old Yorkie brother named Clyde (who was adopted last September). Nelissa said, “we like old dogs with problems!” And Gilbert certainly fits the bill. 😆 We wanted Gilbert to go to a home with another dog for companionship, and we know Clyde’s low energy personality is just enough to keep Gilbert happy and from feeling lonely. Nellissa and Noel are incredibly devoted, gentle doggy parents and just the perfect match for sweet Gilbert! Congrats, old guy!!”</p>
