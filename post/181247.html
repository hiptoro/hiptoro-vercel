			Fans Sign Petition to Take Duggars Off the Air After Josh Duggar's Arrest

			<p>TLC canceled a show called &#8220;19 Kids and Counting&#8221; in 2015 because of a revelation about Josh Duggar (Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar’s oldest child) molesting several young girls (including some of his sisters) in his teenage. It was after that when Josh decided to apologize and went to therapy.</p>
<p>The story is not over. The show &#8220;Counting On&#8221; is about the older children of the family who have started families of their own. Some fans want this show to be canceled as well, and they don&#8217;t want to see any other shows with the family members.</p>
<p>Why? Josh was arrested for possession of child pornography. Time will tell what the truth is with this track record, but he is currently released on bail and claims to be innocent.</p>
<p>David Zaslav, the CEO of Discovery Communications, is being petitioned on Change. She wants to get the family off the air. The family should no longer have a platform. Josh was arrested for child pornography on April 29, 2021. The family should not be allowed to collect money from streaming services. Enough is enough. She said that the money made by the show goes directly to the parents, not to their children. Older siblings can use other platforms to share their stories and make a living.</p>
<p>There are over 24,000 signatures so far, and the goal is to get 25,000.</p>
<p>The show doesn&#8217;t seem to be in danger of being canceled. There is no reason for the show to be canceled since Josh is not a part of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The official statement.</h2>
<p>In an official statement, the network said, &#8220;TLC is sad to learn about the continued troubles involving Josh. 19 Kids and Counting hasn&#8217;t aired in a while. Josh has not appeared on-air since the show was canceled.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do you think the show should be canceled? Do you think Josh will be found guilty? Did you know that Jim Bob and the others made money off of the show?</p>
