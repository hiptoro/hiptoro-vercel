<h2>One of the most frightening nightmares a parent can have is seeing their child taken away.</h2>
<p>In New Mexico, a man tried to abduct two kids in a small grocery store. The whole incident could have ended in tragedy for the parent, but luckily the attempt was stopped before it could damage the house.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t the cops who stopped the attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A wrestler chose to do the right thing when it was needed the most.</h2>
<p>A mother and her three children are waiting for their ride at a gas station. The mother saw a man staring at her and the kids. He grabbed one of them by the arm and demanded the woman give her children to him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>After fighting with the man, the mother took her kids and went to the store.</h2>
<p>The man was chasing them. Store staff members and bystanders rushed to the woman&#8217;s aid. One of the strangers tried to prevent the suspect from entering. The man forced his way into the store and grabbed the stranger who tried to help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The man cannot get out of the store because the stranger pushed the door.</h2>
<p>The commotion was noticed by student-athletes right across the street. He didn&#8217;t think much of it until the mother started screaming. He knew the family and bystanders needed help.</p>

<p>The family hid in the storage room after the suspect tried to break into the store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>With his wrestling training, Bower pinned the suspect to the floor after grabbing him.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-206002" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/03-768x768-1.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="768" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/03-768x768-1.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/03-768x768-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/03-768x768-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/03-768x768-1-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>He was worried if the man had weapons on him like a knife or a gun. He didn&#8217;t hesitate to put the family far from harm&#8217;s way.</p>
<p>Bower held him down. There were sirens outside the store. The suspect was subdued by the cops.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-206001" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/06-768x768-1.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="768" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/06-768x768-1.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/06-768x768-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/06-768x768-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/06-768x768-1-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>For the people involved, it would have felt like the longest five minutes of their lives.</h2>
<p>The suspect was accused of one count of seizing, four counts of battery, two counts of attack, and two counts of child abuse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bower, however, was charged with being the hero.</h2>
<p>The citizens and athletes came together to support him. He was recognized by UFC president Dana White, Henry Cejudo, and Jorge Masvidal. Bower was the USA Wrestling athlete of the week in April. They praised Bower and his act of bravery.</p>

<h2>He said that what really made him proud was knowing that the family he saved was together and safe.</h2>
<p>“When someone needs help you should always help them … always be the one to do something about it,” he said to Sun News.</p>
<p>For the family, he helped, meant the world to them because of his training and athletic prowess.</p>
