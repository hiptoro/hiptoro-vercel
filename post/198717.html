			<p><span class="tBJ dyH iFc sAJ pBj zDA IZT swG">Some wear their hearts on their sleeves for the entire world to see. Others hide their emotions much better and keep their thoughts secret. However, no matter who we are, what we do, and how well we may hide it, we all have inner monologues that reveal our true feelings. </span></p>
<p>Cartoonist Tommy Siegel draws witty comics featuring candy hearts that resonate very well with people because they show our honest feelings which we might be scared to share with everyone else.</p>
<p>The artist said that apart from some drawing lessons he had in elementary school, he’s completely self-taught. “I kinda put drawing on hold for a couple of decades while I was focusing on music, but returned to cartooning recently,” said Tommy. “My drawing skills increased dramatically in the last couple of years. A few weeks ago, I completed a challenge to draw a comic every day for 500 days! It was… an insane thing to do and incredibly difficult, but it definitely helped me develop a voice and challenged me to become a better artist.”</p>

<p>“I drew a comic for Valentine’s Day with candy hearts on a movie date. I noticed it really seemed to resonate with people and realized that the idea of candy hearts having their inner monologues printed on them was a great setup to try again,” explained to the artist how the series started. “Sometimes they’re just light and funny, but my favorites are the ones that get at something deeper about human emotions.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think of them as being unromantic, personally. I just think it’s a good format to draw attention to people’s inner lives, which are often in contrast to the way they appear from the outside,” added Tommy.</p>

<p>However, candy hearts are far from the only drawing ideas Tommy has — he has a wide repertoire of online comics that drew in more than 83,400 followers on Instagram and another 54,500 on Facebook.</p>

<p>Apart from the hearts, the artist joked that he likes to draw a lot of butts: “So I guess I would describe my current style as “lots of butts and sometimes candy hearts.”</p>

<p>“I hail from Richmond, Virginia. But for the last ten years, I&#8217;ve been based in Brooklyn, New York,” Tommy told in an interview. “I&#8217;ve been a full-time musician for most of my adult life in the band Jukebox the Ghost, so cartooning and comic strips as a serious pursuit is still pretty new for me!”</p>

<p>&#8220;The candy heart cartoons raise a serious issue about how a lot of us shy away from sharing our inner lives and real feelings with others, even the people closest to us. Communication is the cornerstone for building lasting relationships and creating genuine connections with others, so it’s important to do it well.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#13<img decoding="async" src="http://static.demilked.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/5d47e10b5c199-candy-hearts-comics-tommy-siegel-8-5d3fe5223e4c8__880.jpg" /></h2>

<p>&#8220;The Better Health Channel writes that it’s important to communicate clearly in relationships because nobody’s a mind-reader. That’s why we should all find the time to talk without any modern distractions like TV or smartphones, accept responsibility for our feelings, genuinely listen to others without butting in, and avoid the desire to always be right.&#8221;</p>
