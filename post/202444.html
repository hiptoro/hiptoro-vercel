			<p>There&#8217;s nothing quite like seeing your newborn baby for the first time.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re perfect after months and months of waiting and trying to prepare yourself for something that you really can&#8217;t prepare for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s the little details that make these moments memorable.</h2>

<p>One father&#8217;s experience with seeing his newborn daughter was made better when that little bundle of joy actually recognized his voice and smiled at him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The proud new father from Brazil, Flavio Dantas, shared this amazing experience on his IG page.</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/dad-talks-baby-reaction-smile/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bored Panda</a>, he spent months leading up to his daughter&#8217;s birth talking to her through her mother&#8217;s womb.</p>
<p>The newborn was definitely listening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>When his daughter was born, Dantas was able to see her for the first time.</h2>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t explain the feeling I felt at that moment,&#8221; he wrote in the translated <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1FFXtrBDEk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caption</a>. &#8220;Every day I talked to my daughter in her mother&#8217;s womb.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">&#8220;I always told her that I loved her.&#8221;</h2>

<p>&#8220;I told her that Dad was there,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;and that I was going to be the best father in the world!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When she was born, how did she repay me? With the sweetest smile ever!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The proud father followed up that photo with many more showing how much he loves his baby girl and how adorable she really is.</h2>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of love in one photo,&#8221; he wrote in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1mqg1_BZBp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> post, adding &#8220;A love that doesn&#8217;t fit inside the chest,&#8221; in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7cSCRrBIUq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He had a lot of kind words for the new addition to the family.</h2>

<p>&#8220;God gave me my biggest reason to raise my head, let go of sadness, and go after the world to be able to give you,&#8221; Dantas wrote beneath this <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4WRtwGBTET/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">touching photo</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The original photo of Dantas&#8217; daughter went viral and earned him 3,796 likes from people who can&#8217;t get over it.</h2>
