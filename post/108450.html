			Stray Dog Interrupts Performance To Help Actor Pretending To Be Injured
		  </h1>
			
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a heartwarming incident, which took place in Izmit, a town in Turkey. What actually happened was that a stray dog came to rescue an injured person. The person was a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Numan Ertuğrul Uzunsoy’s character and was shooting a scene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The script called for a scene where the actor has to lay down on the road and pretend as if he was injured. He told us that “the character I played was injured and in great pain. He’d fallen off a horse, and was breathing hard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The time Uzunsoy laid on the road, his acting didn’t go unnoticed. It&#8217;s because there was a dog who thought that the person is actually injured. So he entered the scene. The dog interrupted the play to offer the &#8220;injured&#8221; stranger comfort. “I felt warmth on my face. First, I thought my co-star was approaching me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After Uzunsoy saw that its a dog, he came out of his character. “I was very happy when I felt the dog&#8217;s kisses. I was very touched. He was like an angel who wanted to help me. It was a very emotional moment for me. I was not expecting it.” He further added that “My castmates loved the dog, and the audience was very happy. Everyone cheered.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then a crew member came and escorted the sweet dog offstage. Uzunsoy says that he wants to meet them again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The next day I went to the same place, looking for him. People told me he usually hangs out there. I went again today. I&#8217;ll look for him until I find him. I&#8217;ve always loved animals.”</span></p>
