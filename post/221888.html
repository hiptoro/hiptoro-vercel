			<p>When you&#8217;re excited to meet someone you might like romantically, there aren&#8217;t many things you wouldn&#8217;t do to get to know that person. You&#8217;ll change plans you&#8217;ve had for a long time, respond to their texts in an embarrassingly quick way (or stop yourself from doing so), feel your heart race whenever they call or text you, and you might even go crazy far out of your way to spend time with them.</p>
<p>Even though it might seem crazy, some people will charter a flight just to meet up with someone they want to date. For example, this woman booked a flight in a strange city to meet up with a guy she met through a mutual friend she FaceTimed with.</p>
<p>TikToker Samantha Marie, who posts under the handle @sdenoyer, stitched together her own &#8220;stood up&#8221; experience with another user, @ayeevuh, who posted a clip of her eating alone.</p>
<blockquote><p>lol date went to the bathroom and never came back,</p></blockquote>
<p>says the text on top.</p>
<p>Samantha then made her own video in response. She is lying in bed and looking through the lens of her camera. This shows that there is an empty spot next to her.</p>
<div style="width: 576px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-0-1" width="576" height="1024" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TikToker-Who-Was-Ditched-by-Date-in-Hotel-After-Flying-Across-the-Country-Learns-His-Secret1.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TikToker-Who-Was-Ditched-by-Date-in-Hotel-After-Flying-Across-the-Country-Learns-His-Secret1.mp4">https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TikToker-Who-Was-Ditched-by-Date-in-Hotel-After-Flying-Across-the-Country-Learns-His-Secret1.mp4</a></video></div>
<blockquote><p>I flew across the country to see this mans and when I woke up from a nap at our hotel he was goneeeee.</p></blockquote>
<h6></h6>
<p>She then shows that the room is empty, and the video cuts to a series of texts between her and the date. The man at the beginning of the conversation seems to say,</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll let you know when I&#8217;m heading back.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=221898" rel="attachment wp-att-221898"><img data-dominant-color="efeeee" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #efeeee;" decoding="async" class="not-transparent aligncenter size-full wp-image-221898" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-1-1657653029061.png" alt="" width="996" height="208" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-1-1657653029061.png 996w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-1-1657653029061-300x63.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-1-1657653029061-768x160.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-1-1657653029061-150x31.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /></a></p>
<p>Then, she tells him that it&#8217;s &#8220;so f***ed up&#8221; that he did this to her. A little over an hour later, she says that he could have at least told her earlier so she could have changed her flight to get home earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=221897" rel="attachment wp-att-221897"><img data-dominant-color="eaeaea" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #eaeaea;" decoding="async" class="not-transparent aligncenter size-full wp-image-221897" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-2-1657653041457.png" alt="" width="996" height="208" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-2-1657653041457.png 996w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-2-1657653041457-300x63.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-2-1657653041457-768x160.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-2-1657653041457-150x31.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /></a></p>
<p>After a few hours, she still hasn&#8217;t heard from the man, so she asks him to call her back. She tells him that she&#8217;s &#8220;confused&#8221; and that she&#8217;s in a city she&#8217;s never been to before and for which she bought her own plane ticket. She also says that it&#8217;s rude of him to just stop answering her texts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=221896" rel="attachment wp-att-221896"><img data-dominant-color="ecebeb" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #ecebeb;" decoding="async" class="not-transparent aligncenter size-full wp-image-221896" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-4-1657653050355.png" alt="" width="984" height="178" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-4-1657653050355.png 984w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-4-1657653050355-300x54.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-4-1657653050355-768x139.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-4-1657653050355-150x27.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px" /></a></p>
<p>In the comments, some people told the woman that spending their own money to see a date in another city is never a good idea. Some people said that the man was probably taking two jobs and wasn&#8217;t answering because he was probably with his wife or partner.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=221895" rel="attachment wp-att-221895"><img data-dominant-color="eeedeb" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #eeedeb;" decoding="async" class="not-transparent aligncenter size-full wp-image-221895" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-5-1657653058969.png" alt="" width="984" height="178" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-5-1657653058969.png 984w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-5-1657653058969-300x54.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-5-1657653058969-768x139.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-5-1657653058969-150x27.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px" /></a></p>
<p>Samantha and others said in the comments that the worst part was that she didn&#8217;t know what was going on.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>In a follow-up post, the TikToker explained what happened: they met online through a friend they both had, and she &#8220;found him attractive&#8221; and &#8220;liked the vibes&#8221; so they started texting and FaceTiming.</p>
<div style="width: 576px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-0-2" width="576" height="1024" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TikToker-Who-Was-Ditched-by-Date-in-Hotel-After-Flying-Across-the-Country-Learns-His-Secret2.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TikToker-Who-Was-Ditched-by-Date-in-Hotel-After-Flying-Across-the-Country-Learns-His-Secret2.mp4">https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TikToker-Who-Was-Ditched-by-Date-in-Hotel-After-Flying-Across-the-Country-Learns-His-Secret2.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>She takes a plane to go see him for a few days, but she doesn&#8217;t get to his city until around midnight. Samantha stays at his &#8220;hometown&#8221; house, and the next day they go to brunch and walk around town. She says that &#8220;most of the time&#8221; she was having fun, and on the second day, they spent time together at a hotel.</p>
<p>They play some board games and then decide to take a nap before going out for the night. He goes to the bathroom, and she falls asleep in bed. When she wakes up, both the man she came to see and his duffel bag are gone, along with the vodka she brought. After that, she began texting him.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=221894" rel="attachment wp-att-221894"><img data-dominant-color="eeeeee" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #eeeeee;" decoding="async" class="not-transparent aligncenter size-full wp-image-221894" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-6-1657653070775.png" alt="" width="984" height="178" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-6-1657653070775.png 984w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-6-1657653070775-300x54.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-6-1657653070775-768x139.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-6-1657653070775-150x27.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px" /></a></p>
<p>Then Samantha called a friend they both knew. He answered the phone, but when he realized it was Samantha&#8217;s friend, he hung up, probably because he didn&#8217;t have her number saved. When her friend answered the phone, &#8220;really loud music&#8221; was playing in the background, according to her friend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=221893" rel="attachment wp-att-221893"><img data-dominant-color="efeeef" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #efeeef;" decoding="async" class="not-transparent aligncenter size-full wp-image-221893" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-7-1657653077976.png" alt="" width="984" height="178" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-7-1657653077976.png 984w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-7-1657653077976-300x54.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-7-1657653077976-768x139.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/date-ditch-cross-country-7-1657653077976-150x27.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px" /></a></p>
<p>Right after that phone call, he texted the TikToker that he had to go to a family emergency. Samantha didn&#8217;t understand why he would bring Vodka to a family emergency. Samantha thought it was all a big waste of time and money, so she took an Uber to the airport.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>But a few weeks later, she found out that the man who dumped her doesn&#8217;t have a wife, as some people had thought, but that he does have a girlfriend. She told everyone everything in a TikTok post.</p>
<div style="width: 576px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-0-3" width="576" height="1024" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TikToker-Who-Was-Ditched-by-Date-in-Hotel-After-Flying-Across-the-Country-Learns-His-Secret3.mp4?_=3" /><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TikToker-Who-Was-Ditched-by-Date-in-Hotel-After-Flying-Across-the-Country-Learns-His-Secret3.mp4">https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/TikToker-Who-Was-Ditched-by-Date-in-Hotel-After-Flying-Across-the-Country-Learns-His-Secret3.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>She says in the video,</p>
<blockquote><p>No he doesn&#8217;t have a wife but he does have a girlfriend, of like three years which is so sad, so I hope she sees this.</p></blockquote>
<p>It turned out that the guy was cheating on his girlfriend not only with Samantha but also with another girl the same weekend.</p>
<blockquote><p>So another girl reached out to me from my other TikToks and was like oh my gosh I think I was with him that weekend.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=221892" rel="attachment wp-att-221892"><img data-dominant-color="f0efef" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #f0efef;" decoding="async" class="not-transparent aligncenter size-full wp-image-221892" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/woman-ghosted-by-guy-1-1659709408323.png" alt="" width="1080" height="174" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/woman-ghosted-by-guy-1-1659709408323.png 1080w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/woman-ghosted-by-guy-1-1659709408323-300x48.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/woman-ghosted-by-guy-1-1659709408323-1024x165.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/woman-ghosted-by-guy-1-1659709408323-768x124.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/woman-ghosted-by-guy-1-1659709408323-150x24.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></a></p>
<p>Samantha continued,</p>
<blockquote><p>And she called me explaining the whole thing. And basically he was with her, the night that I arrived, Saturday. And then he left her to go see me, and the next night he left me to go see her. But he just didn&#8217;t say anything to me. So she sent me the texts between them, before I got there, while I was there, everything.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>So I&#8217;m gonna show you guys.</p></blockquote>
<p>She then showed screenshots of the texts the &#8220;other other woman&#8221; had with the guy who was triple-dipping.</p>
<p>Samantha said that the guy told her that if they had gone to the same college, they &#8220;would have been married by now.&#8221; She called this the &#8220;corniest thing ever.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=221891" rel="attachment wp-att-221891"><img data-dominant-color="f2f1f2" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #f2f1f2;" decoding="async" class="not-transparent aligncenter size-full wp-image-221891" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/woman-ghosted-by-guy-2-1659709419691.png" alt="" width="1080" height="340" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/woman-ghosted-by-guy-2-1659709419691.png 1080w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/woman-ghosted-by-guy-2-1659709419691-300x94.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/woman-ghosted-by-guy-2-1659709419691-1024x322.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/woman-ghosted-by-guy-2-1659709419691-768x242.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/woman-ghosted-by-guy-2-1659709419691-150x47.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></a></p>
<p>In another text conversation between the man and the other-other woman, they finally figure out what happened to the missing bottle: the man stole Samantha&#8217;s bottle of vodka so that he and the other-other woman could drink it together.</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyway, so neither of us are the girlfriend.</p></blockquote>
<p>Samantha finished by saying that she hopes the woman sees the TikTok and &#8220;saves&#8221; the next woman the man talks to.</p>
<p>She gave out his name: Kevin Easley.</p>
