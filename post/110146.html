			<p>Hello dog lovers, we know you have come back for your daily dose of the animal picture. Today, we have a special dog named Brodie for you to meet. At the fragile age of 13 days, this german shepherd and border collie mix was attacked by his mother. This incident made him partially blind and his face permanently disfigured.</p>
<p>Brodie is now in a happy and safe place. His permanent home is now with his owner Amanda Richter and her boyfriend Brad Ames. He is being trained by his owner to be a therapy dog and help people with disabilities lead a happy life. “We hope to train him to be a therapy dog one day so he can help other people with disabilities,” said Amanda Richter.</p>
<p>Brodie has 159K followers on his Instagram account. If you haven&#8217;t yet followed his beautiful dog, do it right away.</p>
<h2>When he was 13 days old, Brodie survived an attack by his own mother that left his face disfigured</h2>

<p>Brodie has suffered from multiple cranial and facial injuries after he was attacked by his mother when he was a child. When he grew, his jaw fused together and he got partially bind.</p>
<h2>Luckily, Brodie found a new forever family who couldn’t care less about his wonky features and believe he was meant for them</h2>

<p>Brodie’s won heart of millions on the Internet but his forever family, Amanda Richter, 30, and boyfriend Brad Ames, 23, were particularly touched.</p>
<p>They spotted him online and decided to travel to the shelter the same day and picked him up. Since then, the bond between them is inseparable.</p>
<p>“He’s definitely hyper, but he is so intelligent. His brain is perfectly fine and he learns tricks within 10 minutes, usually, which tells me he is a smart boy,” Amanda told Hiptoro</p>
<h2>And this adorable pup is now being trained as a therapy dog so he can help anyone living with a disability</h2>

<h2>Before becoming part of his forever family, Brodie was once adopted by a person who gave him back due to the pup’s endless energy</h2>

<p>He is being trained by his mom to be a therapy dog and help others with disabilities and visible differences. “He just needed patience and someone to be consistent,” Amanda said, but added that Brodie is really talented and gets better every week.</p>
