			<p>Snuggling under a blanket with some hot cocoa and watching Christmas movies is one of the most exciting parts of the holiday season.</p>
<p>Some of them are bound to come to mind when you do. Home Alone, A Christmas Story, and Elf.</p>
<p>Some holiday films are so bad that they are on the naughty list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Santa With Muscles.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183175" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/UybJNxlDdLKDgld4TAJI.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="368" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a movie that no one asked for.</p>
<p>It stars a pro wrestler as an evil millionaire who gets amnesia and thinks he&#8217;s Santa. The only positive thing about it is that it has a young actress in it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so bad that it&#8217;s funny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Star Wars Holiday Special.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183176" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4cNoWYoOxxaSj5pLX3ED.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean that a franchise should make a Christmas special.</p>
<p>In this cringe-worthy film, Han Solo and Chewbacca go through a lot of trials to return to their homeland to celebrate Life Day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It was so bad that even Lucas himself wasn&#8217;t a fan of the movie.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-183177" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/lW3w31Wdl49JRFfObcSz.gif" alt="" width="591" height="438" /></p>
<p>“The special from 1978 really didn’t have much to do with us, you know,&#8221; he said in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Holiday_Special" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 interview</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We let them use the characters and stuff and that probably wasn’t the smartest thing to do, but you learn from those experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Home Alone 3.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183178" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/0DxUvjr6NjdLeOqi07jv.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="345" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m tempted to give this one a pass since it&#8217;s one I&#8217;ve seen multiple times and it stars a young girl.</p>
<p>Christmas fans can&#8217;t get past the attempt to make more money out of Home Alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. A Christmas Story 2.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183179" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xJeuWUlZNF7HQ1o6Afgf.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="404" /></p>
<p>When will the movies give a hint? You can&#8217;t touch a classic. That is what A Christmas Story is about.</p>
<p>In the second one, a fifteen-year-old is trying to get a sweet car, but he damages it because of his bad luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. Jingle All the Way 2.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183180" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2omSdCSPLFSf3s4bRiIy.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="810" /></p>
<p>There is a reason Will Ferrell didn&#8217;t want to do Elf 2. He didn&#8217;t want to ruin the first one. Despite being offered $29 million, this was even.</p>
<p>He told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/19/willferrell?fbclid=IwAR35PQWKZzAihZMcLf01itRQID_j31n4MvJcO6oZBRGsRbN6CFBxWt3IhKA">The Guardian</a>, &#8220;I remember asking myself: could I withstand the criticism when it&#8217;s bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>But the movie clearly missed the memo.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-183181" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dlYtu1WODmkX2PV3ZVqd.gif" alt="" width="547" height="410" /></p>
<p>The plot was the same as the first, but there was no magic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. The Christmas Candle.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-183182" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/BF5p3gdy1gDyEcmxN3fC.jpg" alt="" width="614" height="407" /></p>
<p>The holiday film had good intentions, but they failed.</p>
<p>The mix of holiday spirit felt forced and awkward. It&#8217;s already a pretty cynical movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. A Christmas Carol.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183183" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5pTbZaP8BZlzI3AbJ4im.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="440" /></p>
<p>Jim Carrey&#8217;s career was hit by this film.</p>
<p>The movie stayed loyal to the story of Scrooge being visited by a ghost, but it was overshadowed by all the new graphics Disney was trying to show off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>8. Deck the Halls.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183184" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/mLYqC7ofny9q1tnIrbXj.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="678" /></p>
<p>The movie starring Danny and Matthew didn&#8217;t light up the screen.</p>
<p>The plot was about a man trying to make his Christmas lights bright enough to see from space. Broderick was an angry neighbor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9. Tyler Perry&#8217;s A Madea Christmas.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183185" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1GxdQykyb5AHeuTsehwI.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="444" /></p>
<p>Talk about name grabbing.</p>
<p>The Madea franchise is very successful, but this one missed the mark. You couldn&#8217;t help but laugh at the unrealistic nature of most of the scenes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>10. Christmas With the Kranks.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183186" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CAlYIyMeSuGurQcwhshS.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="348" /></p>
<p>Tim Allen and Jamie Lee Curtis were not able to save the film.</p>
<p>There are too many awkward scenes in the show, like when the priest stares at the woman in a bikini at the tanning salon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>11. The Santa Clause 3.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183187" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/JZ5KxSSEQg4yqa5B8wMQ.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></p>
<p>The first two movies were amazing, but the third felt like a major cash grab.</p>
<p>They clearly ran out of ideas. Santa has to protect the North Pole from Jack Frost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>12. The Family Stone.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-183188" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/I79FqBxI4xKKJCFhOj9Z.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="356" /></p>
<p>If you want a Christmas movie that doesn&#8217;t feature traditional warmth, this is it.</p>
<p>It stars some big names, but not even they can save it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The family is mean to the new girlfriend who is being taken home for Christmas.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-183189" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ngTthV2njwi4U9yh20qB.gif" alt="" width="602" height="391" /></p>
<p>Rachel McAdams&#8217;s character is unlikeable.</p>
<p>In the end, the characters end up with different boyfriends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>13. Jack Frost.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183190" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/zcUDPeBA7AmhXYGHWHV5.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></p>
<p>A man is turning into a snowman. I need to say more. Surprisingly, it stars Michael Keaton as the lead.</p>
<p>It has some nice moments, but let&#8217;s not forget about the animated versions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>14. Four Christmas.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183191" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/mEGxjsHD41vAFQy5tKDf.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="536" /></p>
<p>There are four main reasons why this movie was not good. The couple, played by Reese and Vince, was selfish.</p>
<p>Is it possible to lie to your family about your Christmas plans every year?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Also, there was absolutely no chemistry between the two.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-183192" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/vVtP984I1ICz4czwd28o.gif" alt="" width="642" height="361" /></p>
<p>It was hard to take them seriously.</p>
<p>It was missing a lot of humor and the standard warmth of holiday films.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>15. Fred Claus.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183193" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TOt1Ug29Jb2dVyeuPVLG.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s 2 for 2 on Vince Vaughn and Christmas movies.</p>
<p>He played Santa&#8217;s older brother in this one. It ruined the idea of him paying off his debt by working at the North Pole.</p>
