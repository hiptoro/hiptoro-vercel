			<p>The college student who tracked Elon Musk&#8217;s private jet is back on Twitter under a new name. The billionaire banned his first account, @ElonJet, for breaking Twitter rules.</p>
<p>Jack Sweeney, who is 20 years old, said that he started following Elon Musk&#8217;s private jet in 2020 because he was a fan. After he had stopped using Twitter for more than two years, Elon Musk threatened to sue him.</p>
<p>A source has learned that Sweeney will continue to track Musk&#8217;s private jet, but with a 24-hour delay. He will do this under the new username @ElonJetNextDay. The move comes after the billionaire changed the rules of Twitter, where he is now the CEO after buying it on October 27.</p>

<p>Sweeney said in an interview on Thursday that he will &#8220;post by hand&#8221; for the time being because &#8220;the framework for automating isn&#8217;t there yet.&#8221; He also said that it is hard to say when the account will be fully automated.</p>
<p>He also said that &#8220;@ElonJet is still available elsewhere,&#8221; such as on the site Truth Social run by former President Donald Trump. Sweeney said that he will also add other accounts, such as @CelebJets, to sites like Instagram and Facebook.</p>
<p>Sweeney had more than 30 accounts to keep an eye on politicians and billionaires like Trump, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos, who started Amazon.</p>
<p>But Musk, who earlier this year offered to pay Sweeney to get rid of the old account, didn&#8217;t like it when public information about his and other public figures&#8217; whereabouts was shared online. For example, he didn&#8217;t like it when he said a &#8220;crazy stalker&#8221; followed a car with his two-year-old son in it.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>Around the same time, Twitter posted what it said was a new rule that made it hard to post someone&#8217;s live location. It said that the update would &#8220;make it harder to share someone else&#8217;s live location in most cases&#8221; by removing tweets and suspending accounts that were used to do so.</p>
<p>According to its new rules, it is not against the law to &#8220;share publicly available location information after a reasonable amount of time has passed and the person is no longer at risk of physical harm.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Any account doxxing real-time location info of anyone will be suspended, as it is a physical safety violation,</p></blockquote>
<p>Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1603181423787380737?s=20&amp;t=wLkcuo-FY_dQXtVnTp1HHw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> on December 15.</p>
<blockquote><p>This includes posting links to sites with real-time location info.</p></blockquote>
<p>He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Posting locations someone traveled to on a slightly delayed basis isn&#8217;t a safety problem, so is ok.</p></blockquote>
