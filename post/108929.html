			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How would you feel if someone tried to steal the love of your life? Well, you would be pretty jealous and mad. But not when a gorgeous feline is stealing your partner. This might sound a little weird to some people but it is true. Yes, this story is based on a real incident and it took place in Thailand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This whole thing got popular after </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasrin Hami, the wife posted a series of pictures of her husband and cat. In the pictures, you can clearly see how possessive the cat is for Nasrin’s husband. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the post got noticed by Super Cats, a well-known Facebook page, it got more than thousands of likes. Also, the cat’s name is Jarvis and he is a Scottish Fold cat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can scroll down to check out the entire thing. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While telling a few things about her stunning cat, Nasrin said that Jarvis is a good cat and he only eats cat food. Also, he has never ever tried human food, not even fish. She further added </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jarvis is a good cat. He likes to sleep, watch the birds at the window, and play with my husband.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Jarvis is always loving and affectionate with my husband and he acts the same way with me and is friendly with everyone who visits our home.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasrin also told us that most of the people on the Internet thought that Jarvis is female. However, she confirmed that Jarvis is, in fact, male. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year on 23rd April, Jarvis has celebrated his 6th birthday. So this cat has been living with the owner for a long time. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasrin on her popular Facebook page Baan Nee Tong Mee Meow has also made it clear that Jarvis is not for sale. Nasrin also told us that the cat spends most of his time with her husband. The cat lays on top of him, cuddles him, and does pretty much everything to stay as close of him as possible. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nasrin even told us that whenever her husband would sit to eat, the cat goes near him to show affection. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While doing a little research about Scottish Fold cats, we found that they are good-natured and very sweet. Also, this cat is a great household pet and get very attached to its owner. (We all can see that, right?)</span></p>
