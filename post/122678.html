			<p>Stories, where a person meets his family after several years on Christmas eve, are only seen in movies. But what if we told you that this is a real story of a determined son and a lost father? Would you believe it? Nah, we don&#8217;t think so. After all, this is quite dramatic. But hopefully, it&#8217;s a real incident and it took place in England.</p>
<h2>This determined son was dedicated to find</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-122679 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-82.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-82.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-82-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The story is of Jason Kelly, a 23-year-old from Tuebrook, who wanted to find his long-lost father, David Kelly. Sadly both of them haven&#8217;t seen each other for 10 years. Jason told us “I remember also, once when I was eight, I made a giant snowball and threw it over him and that really annoyed him and that was the last time I saw him until I was 12.”</p>
<p>“When I was about 12, I was walking home from school with a friend. I was walking down the main road and I saw him riding past on his bike—he looked me directly in the eye and smiled at me. I felt almost paralyzed with shock and that was the last time I saw him.”</p>
<h2>Upon finding his father, who didn’t have permanent housing, Jason had to chase him down because the man was overwhelmed</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-122680 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-77.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1051" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-77.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-77-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-77-682x1024.jpg 682w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>After Jason&#8217;s grandfather passed away, he became even more determined to find his father. And that&#8217;s where all the story started from. “I was shouting ‘Dad, it’s me, Jason.’ Eventually, it started to sink in and I caught up to walk beside him.”</p>
<h2>After meeting again with the help of social media, Jason and David are taking slow steps towards repairing their relationship</h2>

<p>Jason said, “When he recognized me, he started asking after the family and he was trying to remember my birth date. At that point, he didn’t want to look at me as his eyes were welling up with tears.” Jason admitted he was equally emotional since he was “exactly the same when it comes to things like that.”</p>
<p>“I’m trying to see if I can get his birth certificate. He can’t access a bank account as he needs proof of person and he doesn’t have anything.”</p>
<h2>People online expressed universal support and sent well-wishes Jason and David’s way</h2>
