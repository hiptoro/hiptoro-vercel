After all, seeing a messy place getting cleaned is very soothing and nothing in this world can beat this feeling. If you also think this way, this post is going to treat your eyes with the before and after pictures from power washing projects. These pictures will surely calm your OCD down and you can thank us later for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, after seeing the pictures, don’t forget to tell us which part of your home needs power washing. </span></p>
<p><em>(One note of warning: if you use a pressure washer, follow the instructions carefully; do not use it to wash animals or other people, no matter how dirty they may have gotten.)</em></p>

<p>To understand more about power washing, we reached out to a Dublin-based power washer. This man runs The Powerwash Man and he told us &#8220;Everyone, from kids to older people enjoy watching our videos&#8221;. &#8220;I think this may be because satisfaction is nearly instantaneous, seeing the results before your eyes. And with the ease of the power washer, it is so satisfying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With Covid this year, it&#8217;s thrown everyone off. We&#8217;ve seen a difference from last year. At first, we were just ticking by, but as people were at home, the business actually went up. I&#8217;d say, as customers were looking at the dirt and grime every day, they decided to get their power washing done&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We had to approach how we dealt with customers differently, as I love to shake a customer&#8217;s hand at the start, tell them who I am, and have the chats. This year, I find I&#8217;m not engaging the same as in the past due to Covid, but I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be back to normal soon.&#8221;</p>
