<p>Well, in this story, a man who wanted to bring a dog home to give him some company ended up adopting a cat instead.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in Virginia for some training. At this specific time, a pretty large snow was blowing through. When I was on my way home I heard on the radio that a shelter called Richmond Animal League was looking for temporary/permanent homes for all of their animals, as the staff expected to get snowed in,&#8221; Spamwisejamkey an ImgurÂ user said.</p>
<p>He was living by himself all this while. So, he decided to get a furry friend home. But when he went to the shelter, all the dogs were already adopted.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was great, but I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to simply leave without even considering what I had gone there for.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, then he was being taken to the little kitty room, &#8220;The woman who was working, saw that I wasn&#8217;t really moved by any of these potential housemates, so she showed me back out to the lobby where they had some younger creatures separated in cages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-143809 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-189.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-189.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-189-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>A little cat was kept behind in a cage and the woman told him that he could hold the cat if he wanted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I opened the cage, picked her up and that was it. She started meowing the most pathetic little chirps as she pushed her face to the brim of my cap (this is when they got the picture), only to be backed by a rumble of purring. I turned into a huge sap,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t like or ever want cats before this. Simply put; I shook my head with a nod of acceptance, put her back in the cage for a brief moment while I did the paperwork, and got ready to take her home. They didn&#8217;t have pups, but they did have my best bud. I was not a cat guy, but I guess you could say I&#8217;m a cat guy now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The kitty has been renamed &#8216;Barb&#8217;.</p>
<h2>&#8220;This is where Barb likes to hang when I get home.&#8221;</h2>

<div class="articles-info-box">
<p>Barb is now one beautiful and amazing cat, &#8220;She is definitely the matriarch of the household as she keeps all of the other creatures in check. A cuddler and purrer for sure. She still acts like a needy little kitten &#8211; loves all people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Six months after he adopted Barb, he went and adopted a dog named Rupert. Barb quickly took the dog under her wings and now they are inseparable.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are always playing or snuggling when they aren&#8217;t snuggled up to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Barbara and I are best buds accompanied by my pup, Rupert, along with my girlfriend and her two cats, Bruce and Joe. It&#8217;s a good life.&#8221;</p>
