			<p>It can be exciting to see your children get engaged and married. Some parents save engagement rings for these moments if they have a family heirloom. This isn&#8217;t always everyone&#8217;s cup of tea.</p>
<p>One mom explained in a recent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/pdaril/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pass_down_my_enggement/">post</a> that her son recently announced that he was getting engaged to his girlfriend. She was very happy. He asked his mom if he could get her a diamond instead of buying one for his fiancée. He didn&#8217;t want to be in debt when he married.</p>
<p>The woman said that her ring wasn&#8217;t something she imagined passing down to her son. It wasn&#8217;t an old ring that was passed down. She couldn&#8217;t imagine not being able to wear the ring just yet, it&#8217;s a special ring symbolizing her and her husband&#8217;s love.</p>
<p>“I love my engagement ring. I have worn it every day since my husband proposed to me with it and to be honest, I still have plenty of years to live that I want to keep wearing it until I am old and grey,” she explained in the post. “Also, my ring is not a family heirloom. My husband chose and bought this ring for me many years ago. So, I told them that I appreciated them wanting my ring, but no, I wanted to keep it.”</p>
<p>She said that she told her son and his girlfriend that one day they could have it. She was not ready to part with it just yet.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t take that information well. “Sam [my son] actually called me selfish and materialistic,” she said. “He said that diamonds are a scam and asked how I could let him go into debt to buy a new ring.”</p>
<p>She asked the world at the end of the post. Is her son in the wrong?</p>
<div class="ad_ph">Most people agreed. Her son and future wife were being unfair to her.</div>
<div></div>
<div>“It would be different if this were a family heirloom sitting in a jewelry box somewhere but it’s not. The self-entitlement is real here,” someone said. “The fact that they have been together for a while and ‘finally decided to get married’ tells me that he had time to save for a ring of her own. The audacity to ask for the ring of your hand blows my mind.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>“This is crazy, the cheek they had to even ask! I could understand if they were asking for grandma’s ring which you wore after she died or something but not your own engagement ring!” another appalling commenter wrote. “Rings become passed down after death in the family, not whilst people are still married and alive.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>“They are not entitled to the ring off of your finger,” another agreed. “Your husband gave that ring to you, and it’s important to you. It’s time for them to figure out their own preferences, etc.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>Who is the jerk in this situation?</div>
