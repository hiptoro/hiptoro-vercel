			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A clean home is like heaven and it is always welcoming to come to a clean house. It takes a lot of effort to maintain and keep your house clean but it has its own advantages and perks. If you clean regularly and effectively, your house will always look as good as new. Hygienically it is important to live in a clean house. Here are some great benefits or importance of regular house clean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">House cleaning is a very challenging task that we all have to do at some time. The main motive of getting the place clean and organized is to make it an inviting and most peaceful place to stay in and relax. There are plenty of handy organizing tips available that come in very useful when you are planning to clean and organize your place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sometimes messes are caused by the products that we use. Well, the very products we use to keep our homes clean. Take laundry detergent, for example. If you like to save money (don’t we all?) you probably purchase a bulk-size laundry detergent. That probably also means that no matter how much effort you put into keeping your laundry room clean, there is an unsightly laundry detergent cup somewhere in that room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These large size laundry detergent bottles come with a convenient cup that we can use to measure out the correct amount of detergent, but some of the detergents linger inside the cup after we pour it into the washer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you have one of these blue-coated laundry detergent cups in your laundry room, we have some very good news. It turns out that there is a super-easy way to clean it, and if we had been paying closer attention, we would’ve known this all along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To keep it clean </span><span style="font-weight: 400">you can wash it with soap and water (duh) or you can toss it in your washing machine! That’s right. After pouring the laundry detergent into the washer, you can toss the cup right inside the machine along with your clothes! </span></p>
