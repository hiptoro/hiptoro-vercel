			<p>You have a dog and you want personal space, you must be joking, right?</p>
<p>We know how it feels to have a dog that just won’t understand the concept of personal space. It feels like the dog is stalking and following you every time. Well, that’s exactly what the dog does. Dogs love his hoomas so much that he can’t be away from them even for a SECOND.</p>
<p>But hopefully, you are not alone. Many other pet parents are facing this similar situation and we have got pictures.</p>
