			<p>A puppy that was left at an airport four months ago has found a new home with a United Airlines employee and his family, the company says.</p>
<p>A representative for United Airlines said that the 6-month-old German Shepherd mix was left at a terminal at San Francisco International Airport. The dog had been traveling with his previous owner from another country.</p>
<p>According to the same source, the traveler left the puppy in the terminal after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told them their paperwork to bring the puppy into the country was not valid. Based on where they&#8217;re coming from, especially if they&#8217;re coming from a country with a high risk of rabies, CDC rules say that dogs must meet certain requirements to enter the US, and they may need to be quarantined when they get here. United&#8217;s statement did not say where the dog and its previous owner were coming from.</p>
<p>At the time, United flew the puppy, which employees named Polaris, to Los Angeles. From September to early December, the dog was kept in a quarantine facility there, according to a United representative, who said that there wasn&#8217;t a good enough facility in San Francisco.</p>
<p>United said in a statement that after the quarantine period was over, they worked with the San Francisco SPCA to find Polaris a new home.</p>
<blockquote><p>United&#8217;s Customer Service team took on quite a challenge to ensure Polaris would be safe, healthy, and find a loving home,</p></blockquote>
<p>said Lisa Feder, who is in charge of rescue and welfare at the SF SPCA.</p>
<p>The airline representative claimed that United employees at the San Francisco airport took care of Polaris by feeding him, giving him treats, and giving him toys before allowing him to remain in the US.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>Then, at the beginning of December, Captain William Dale of United Airlines and his family took Polaris in.</p>

<blockquote><p>Polaris is doing incredible and adjusting to his new home,</p></blockquote>
<p>Dale said.</p>
<p>He also said that he was &#8220;extremely grateful&#8221; to the United employees at San Francisco International Airport for taking care of the puppy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Their hard work has made this a much easier transition for Polaris,</p></blockquote>
<p>he said.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are so grateful for our new furry family member.</p></blockquote>
<p>United Airlines held an adoption party at the airport where Polaris was left on December 15, and they gave $5,000 to the SF SPC. Polaris and his new family were there, and Polaris was dressed up as Santa Claus.</p>
