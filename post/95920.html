			<p>If you ever visit the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BullockBabies/">Bullock County Humane Society</a> in Alabama, I bet you can&#8217;t pass the pup Speck&#8217;s cage without shaking his paw and saying &#8216;Hi!&#8217;.</p>
<p>He may be a simple dog but you can&#8217;t forget the sparkle in his eyes and your interaction with him.</p>
<p>The moment Speck sees any person passing by his cage, he pushes his face between the metal bars. Then he sticks his paws out of the cage to hold the hands of the person.</p>

<p>Desiray Miracle-Wilder, the shelter’s director, told The Dodo:</p>
<blockquote><p>All he wants is people&#8217;s love. He will reach his little hand out and he just wants you to touch him and hold his hand. And he’s so sad when you walk off to finish cleaning or whatever you have to do.</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Wilder says that Speck wants to be loved and trusted.</strong></h2>
<p>Speck has been waiting in his Kennel in Alabama for a perfect family that would take him home. By judging the scars on his face, it can be said that he had a tough time living on the streets. Now he wants to be trusted and loved by a family.</p>

<p>Wilder said,</p>
<blockquote><p>You could put anything else around him — another giant dog, a cat, but he is just so fixated on getting love from people that he doesn’t care about anything else</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, she said, &#8220;He just wants you to touch him. If you sit down, he’s laying on you. If you hold his hand, he’ll hold your hand, if you scratch his belly, he’ll roll over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last Thursday, Wilder was cleaning Speck&#8217;s Kennel and suddenly wanted to capture his holding hand gesture. People just can&#8217;t get enough of this cute pup.</p>

The clip went viral and got almost 96,000 views in a matter of a few days.</p>
<h2><strong>After a few days, Wilder gave us a piece of great news!</strong></h2>
<p>The post caught the attention of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AHFPDogRescue/?__xts__[0]=68.ARCKuhfeFwWLjgZRFA-jhmgN-aWO6zg0d6K3cCRfO0fMhGc_eewlbwjw9Y_5H5j_IixF20fCxubVeuEv_EvPBqsrStiCuI7IDBRsbgiSFNjAtrTBKUy6i4xo2dw75Pfg18m8TV6haH2z-u3BsRQS498_mcey3qgrH5IkTEtAPKOMoRVlLl9r3ICOC_gJ5RhvK9vSgPnyuBl5IgxsXGm3uu9sMgxvbg">Allie&#8217;s Hope For Paws Dog Rescue.</a> They helped the dog to connect with an adopter.</p>
<p>Wilder wrote on Facebook, &#8220;He will be running on a 26-acre farm with Mike, his family, and two fur brothers! We are so excited. Not only did Speck get adopted due to this video of his cuteness but he also helped a few other fur babies get rescued and he got us some food donations!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, Speck is waiting for his family to come and pick him up. He has left behind some of his fur friends in the kennel who are still waiting for a family to adopt them. But we are sure that Speck&#8217;s video and his story must have inspired people to adopt other dogs.</p>
