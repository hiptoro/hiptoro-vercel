			<p>Ben Affleck&#8217;s comments about how much he drank when he was married to Jennifer Garner have raised a few eyebrows.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s part of why I started drinking … because I was trapped,</p></blockquote>
<p>the Oscar winner said in an interview with Howard Stern on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daredevil,&#8221; which came out in 2003, starred Affleck and Garner. Affleck has been open about his alcoholism. They got married in 2005, and in 2018, they got divorced. Together, they had three children. Violet is 16 years old, Seraphina is 12 years old, and Samuel is 9 years old. Reports say that he even asked her for help, and she put him in touch with someone who could help him. He said that even though he was married, his focus was still on his children.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was like ‘I can’t leave ‘cause of my kids, but I’m not happy, what do I do?’</p></blockquote>
<p>he said.</p>
<blockquote><p>What I did was drink a bottle of scotch and fall asleep on the couch, which turned out not to be the solution.</p></blockquote>
<p>Affleck, who got a Golden Globe nomination for &#8220;The Tender Bar&#8221; and reportedly got back together with Jennifer Lopez, said he and Garner were not meant to be together.</p>
<blockquote><p>We had a marriage that didn’t work, this happens, with somebody that I love and respect, but to whom I shouldn’t be married any longer,</p></blockquote>
<p>he said.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ultimately, we tried. We tried, we tried because we had kids,</p></blockquote>
<p>he added.</p>
<blockquote><p>Both of us felt like we don’t want this to be the model that our kids see of marriage.</p></blockquote>
<p>People certainly talked about what Affleck said on Twitter, and many of them called him out.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ben Affleck made it sound on Stern that marriage to Jennifer Garner was so insufferable that it drove him to drink,</p></blockquote>
<p>another person said.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if he believes that, you don’t say it for the sake of the kids or to be a person of integrity. Maybe Jennifer Lopez should re-think things.</p></blockquote>
