<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We had also talked with AHS Media Relations Specialist Kelsey Dickerson to know why we feel better when we are around dogs. She said, &#8220;There are so many incredible benefits of owning a pet that goes beyond the joy they bring to us each and every day, studies prove that having a furry friend greatly improves our mental and physical health as well, especially during these times when quarantine and social distancing has led people to stay at home and decreased in-person interaction.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She further said that &#8220;A few physical benefits of owning a pet include lowered stress levels, increased heart health (i.e. lower blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, etc.), helping you and your family stay in shape with increased opportunities for exercise and outdoor activities with your pets, as well as increased socialization opportunities with other people and pet owners.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Pets also help improve our mental health by offering us unconditional love and companionship, especially for those who live by themselves or are unable to socialize with others on a regular basis.
