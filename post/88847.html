			<p>Taking care of pets is not an easy task for pet groomers. Caring does not mean taking your pet to walk and feeding them but it includes a lot more than that.</p>
<p>It is also about maintenance which is expensive at times. This is actually not the issue but the problem is with the human mentality of comparing things.</p>
<p>People usually compare a hairdresser with a pet groomer while both of them have completely different jobs. The task done seems to be quite similar but the risk involved is very different. Usually, pet owners complain about the high rates charged to them when they go to a pet grooming shop. They are the first time owners and need to understand the process.</p>
<p>For making things transparent and clearer pet groomers are now using signboards in their clinics mentioning the leading ten reasons for the high cost.</p>
<p>The following are the reasons which are usually mentioned. Check them out below-</p>

<h3>#10 Your hairdresser doesn’t wash and clean your rear end.</h3>
<p>The hairdresser is not responsible for cleaning and grooming your rare end. But a pet groomer does so. It is not that easy as it sounds. Dogs are not comfortable at all if they are touched by strangers so it&#8217;s risky also.</p>
<h3>#9 You don’t go eight weeks without washing or brushing your hair.</h3>
<p>The dogs are really energetic and they play in the dirt and become messy. Special service is required to clean them which requires lots of effort and special tools.</p>
<h3>#8 Your hairdresser doesn’t give you a sanitary trim.</h3>
<p>Trimming near your pet’s genitalia is actually a lot more risky task than anything else. Hence it can only be done by experienced professionals.</p>
<h3>#7 Your hairdresser doesn’t clean your ears.</h3>
<p>Special skills are required to clean the ears and they provide special cleaning services which a hairdresser doesn&#8217;t. The ears are sensitive and are prone to infections.</p>
<h3>#6 Your hairdresser doesn’t remove the boogers from your eyes.</h3>
<p>Unlike humans dog also develop boogers which need to be cleaned as they develop infections.<br />
This is also a sensitive part and needs to be cleaned with expertise.</p>

When a groomer will clean each and every part of your dog’s body, it’s just natural that the dog will become uncomfortable and eventually aggressive. A lot of times, the owners assist groomers by petting their dogs and calming them down, however, sometimes, the dogs end up biting or scratching the groomer for touching their soft butt. #1 The likelihood of you pooping on your hairdresser is pretty slim. When the hairdresser is giving a haircut, the chances are your dog is going to sit in one spot for most of the time.

<h3>#5 You sit still for your hairdresser.</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s just hard to handle our four-legged furballs as they are energetic in nature and has the tendency to play all the time. It is a special effort put down by the pet groomers to control them and do the grooming part with expertise.</p>
<h3>#4 Your haircut doesn’t include a manicure or pedicure.</h3>
<p>Coming to our pets they need a proper manicure and pedicure as they develop dirt in their nails which needs to be cleaned.</p>
<h3>#3 Your hairdresser only washes and cuts the hair on your head.</h3>
<p>The area of the chest, arms, legs, and in between also need to be trimmed alongside the head. But this is something your dog hairdresser wouldn’t do.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-88850" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dd.jpg" alt="Your hairdresser only washes and cuts the hair on your head." width="700" height="633" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dd.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dd-300x271.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dd-561x507.jpg 561w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dd-364x329.jpg 364w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/dd-608x550.jpg 608w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>

<p>Now, if the groomer asks for more money, just know that part of it is also their ‘cost of doing business.’</p>
