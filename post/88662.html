			<p>One company has come up with great work to show us all with their new and innovative pet beds. It&#8217;s always good to decorate your room with furniture. Especially when you have great taste in decorating the living room practically.</p>
<p>The majority always prefers to keep up the color matching of the furniture to the walls or to the long curtains. But, after some time people tend to bend towards the convenient side of this. That is the legit way to choose furniture that is according to the comfortability of the body posture.</p>
<h3>Why “share” a bed with your pet (we both know they hog it) if you can give them their own space?</h3>

<p>The pet beds are well equipped with 6 drawers for storage that is three on each side. This way of saving a bunch of space that would have otherwise been wasted. The drawers are neatly fitted in the bottom part of the bed frame. The bed frame is said to be made of pinewood with varying colors stain, featuring golden oak, classic gray, dark walnut, early American, and a bunch more of them.</p>
<p>Country Creations sell these as a set for $1,200, which is a king-sized bed frame with a toddler-sized dog bed, steps, and two-night stands. But these sets can also be customized to some extent. The frame (with storage only) would cost the customers about $800. And the dog bed and steps for you to add to your current bed would cost around $300, and the two nightstands separately would cost $100.</p>
<h3>The bed itself also comes with ample opportunities for storing everything from clothes to unused stuff</h3>

Either that or you can organize your own shipping.</p>
<p>The majority of the people have given a thumbs up to this unique idea over the internet. Despite the fact, they could not afford such liked bed for their pets due to lack of space. But has ensured to buy if they relocate to a bigger and spacious one.</p>
