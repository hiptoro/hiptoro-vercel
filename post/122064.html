			<p>The harsh wind and cold weather can make humans cry out for help. Imagine, what a creature who can&#8217;t speak would have dog to seek help? This story that we are sharing with you today, is about a cat who tried surviving for long outside in snow and wind. Ultimately, he had no other choice to knock at a stangers door to beg for help.</p>
<p>On Valentines day, a woman heard strange sound in the backyard and went to see from where the sound was coming. An orange tabby standing outside the window pawing at the door, and meowing.The woman took a picture and contacted Marie Simard, the founder of Un Chat à la Fois, a kitten rescue in Quebec, Canada.</p>

<p>“He went into the carrier by himself and once he got to the vet, he was very easy-going, he let the vet do the checkup, the blood test and X-rays, the cat was not feral at all,” Simard said. She named the cat Aslan, in honor of the lion in <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> series.</p>
<p>“We thought he was a lost cat because he was just too friendly to be born outside. He didn’t have a microchip and was not neutered. We assumed he was left behind by irresponsible owners. We have many cats left behind by people—people that cannot afford to pay the vet care. We checked everywhere for a missing cat but we found nothing.”</p>

<p>“Aslan had rotten teeth, frostbite, a bite wound (he was bleeding somewhere on his body), fleas, worms, he had diabetes and skin allergy. His blood work was very bad and he had to stay hospitalized a few days so he could be stabilized before going to his foster family.”</p>
<p>“He got surgery for his rotten teeth. He also had issues with his eyes, which were taken care of with surgery.”</p>
<p>The vet mentioned that Aslan was exhausted and very sick.  His survival in the cold was questionable if he hadn’t received immediate attention.</p>

<p>Aslan the cat, was grateful to people who answered her meows. She put out her paws out of the cage so that people at the clinic could pet her.</p>

<p>“He had become friends with 2 rescue cats, Cleo and Jasmin. Jasmin sadly passed away, but Aslan is very close to Cleo. Aslan has a special diet due to his diabetes, but he likes food! In fact, his mom needs to closely watch her own plates because Aslan would not hesitate to steal her food. Sometimes, she makes an exception and gives him a treat.”</p>
<p>“Aslan is a very affectionate cat. He forgot his outdoor life, he doesn’t try to go outside. He likes to sleep on her pillow and he likes to cuddle.”</p>
