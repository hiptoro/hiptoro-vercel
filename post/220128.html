			<p>Brittney Griner is back home and has been busy getting her life back in order. Her supporters are glad that she was freed in a prisoner swap for Viktor Bout, who is known for selling weapons around the world. Some people on the Internet are still upset about her coming back, and they talk about the time she kneeled down during the national anthem.</p>
<p>The athlete has been in the news for her views on the national anthem, and she has kneeled down during the national anthem at a game to protest the death of George Floyd. A source says that when the Phoenix Mercury played their first game in the WNBA bubble in July 2020, she did not take the floor for the national anthem.</p>
<p>Arizona Central says that she said in 2020,</p>
<blockquote><p>I honestly feel we should not play the National Anthem during our season. I think we should take that much of a stand. I don&#8217;t mean that in any disrespect to our country. My dad was in Vietnam and was a law officer for 30 years. I wanted to be a cop before basketball. I do have pride for my country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, Brittney added,</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m going to protest regardless; I&#8217;m not going to be out there for the National Anthem. If the league continues to want to play it, that&#8217;s fine. It will be all season long; I&#8217;ll not be out there. I feel like more are probably going to do the same thing. I can only speak for myself.</p></blockquote>
<p>She explained,</p>
<blockquote><p>At the Olympics, I understand; you&#8217;re playing for your country at that point.</p></blockquote>

<p>Her wife, Cherelle Griner, said that the two of them are on a path to healing. She said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday my heart was made whole thanks to the collective efforts of MANY! Iâ€™m humbled by their hearts. To care for another, a stranger to some, a friend to someâ€” is humanity in its purest form! As BG and I start our journey to heal our minds, bodies, and spiritsâ€” I wanted to personally say thank you to some of the hands; seen and unseen, that helped make it possible for me to see my wife again!</p></blockquote>
<p>The post also added,</p>
<blockquote><p>I appreciate each and every one of you! Let&#8217;s continue to use our hands, voices, platforms, and resources to bring Paul and all Americans home.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>&#8220;Every WNBA game should have to sing the US National Anthem.&#8221;</h2>
<p>People are still talking about how Brittney feels about the national anthem on the Internet. Someone on Twitter said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Brittney Griner should be made to sing the US National Anthem at every WNBA game from now untill she dies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another added,</p>
<blockquote><p>I double dog dare Brittney Griner to kneel during the national anthem 1st game back.</p></blockquote>
<p>A tweet stated,</p>
<blockquote><p>Brittney Griner kneeling for the national anthem during her game in the United States&#8230;. wth? And the President of the United States wanted this.</p></blockquote>
<p>A tweet explained,</p>
<blockquote><p>I have a question. Will Brittney Griner stand up for the American National Anthem now that she&#8217;s seen what a real communist country is?!!</p></blockquote>
<p>Another user explained,</p>
<blockquote><p>I wonâ€™t forget â€¦ Brittney Griner actively refused to be present during the playing of the U.S. National Anthem before games, and even demanded the Anthem and flag ceremony be avoided in all games. Now sheâ€™s being revered as some sort of American hero. Idiots.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Brittney Griner would not even stand for the American Anthem which shows total disrespect for America and our Military that risks their lives to protect our beautiful home land which she is now having the comfort of enjoying, while others are not,</p></blockquote>
<p>said another user.</p>
<p>Another user tweeted,</p>
<blockquote><p>Do you think Brittney Griner will stand for the National Anthem now? I sure hope so!!</p></blockquote>
