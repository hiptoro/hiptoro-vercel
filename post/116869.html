			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guys, what would you do if you were fostering a cute cat and after getting stronger, it refuses to leave you? Well, this is exactly what had happened with an experienced rescuer, Jess. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, a few weeks back, a litter of small kittens were rescued. These cuties were brought to a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">shelter in Montreal, Canada. While most of the kittens were weak, the ginger kitten was the one that needed most of the attention and care. That’s when Jess entered and took the responsibility of taking care of this cutie. She started feeding the cat and giving him unconditional love. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-116870 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="674" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1-1.jpg 980w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1-1-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-1-1-768x528.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of this cutie is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baby Mars and he is very small. Jess thought that once this kitten becomes healthy, he can easily be adopted. She planned to leave the cat at Chatons Orphelins Montréal so that he can get a better life. But seems like this ginger cat had planned something else.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-116871 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="674" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-1-1.jpg 980w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-1-1-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-1-1-768x528.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Jess took great care of the kitten. She fed him every couple of hours, kept him warm, and loved him. That&#8217;s what saved his life,&#8221; Celine Crom of Chatons Orphelins Montréal told us.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-116872 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="647" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-1-1.jpg 980w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-1-1-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-1-1-768x507.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Jess was fostering the cat, she has never thought about adopting him. But she couldn&#8217;t deny what Baby Mars has planned. </span></p>

<p>Watch Mars the kitten in this cute video:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, this cutie is all grown up and he always gets into fights with other cats. Mostly, those cats are much bigger than our Baby Mars. </span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-116874 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="674" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-1-1.jpg 980w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-1-1-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-1-1-768x528.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;He is very persuasive with his little meows and big eyes. Sometimes, he will wait and stare at his human until he gets what he wants — cuddles.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-116875 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="674" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7-1-1.jpg 980w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7-1-1-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7-1-1-768x528.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;At three months old, Mars was officially adopted by his foster family. It&#8217;s the perfect match,&#8221; Celine told us.</p>
