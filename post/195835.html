			<p>If kids make choices that get them into trouble, parents aren&#8217;t always going to agree with them. When a child is suspended from school, it&#8217;s common for their parents to be angry.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to see an occurrence where a parent upholds the way of behaving that got their kid suspended, generally in light of the fact that there are not very many occasions in which getting into a battle at school is a praiseworthy activity instead of a dishonorable one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A mother took to Facebook to show her support for her son, who was suspended for five days.</h2>

<p>Allison Arnall Davis explained that her son, Drew, was given a five-day off-school suspension &#8220;for beating up the kid that has been tormenting and bullying him since middle school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>She was not sharing the news to shame Drew.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-195844" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mom-Goes-Viral-After-Defending-Her-Son-For-Beating-Up-His-Bully.gif" alt="" width="622" height="350" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I know as a parent I’m supposed to be upset with him for resorting to violence or getting suspended,&#8221; she shared, &#8220;But I’m not. Not even a little bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">&#8220;For years, the school has failed Drew.&#8221;</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-195837" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/W2e4p6BNsivZUGYJIxwN.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="901" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/W2e4p6BNsivZUGYJIxwN.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/W2e4p6BNsivZUGYJIxwN-213x300.jpg 213w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The school took no action when Drew&#8217;s bully threatened him in person and over social media, and even followed Drew down the hall threatening him and making fun of him, all captured on video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">&#8220;When this kid took to social media, voicemails, and texting threats, the school did nothing.&#8221;</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-195845" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mom-Goes-Viral-After-Defending-Her-Son-For-Beating-Up-His-Bully_2.gif" alt="" width="680" height="377" /></p>
<p>The school gets an F for its terrible policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Davis wrote a letter to the school asking them to take action against the bully.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-195839" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OzQAderr6zS14TsmeBG7.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OzQAderr6zS14TsmeBG7.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OzQAderr6zS14TsmeBG7-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Drew had four classes with this kid and he would not leave Drew alone,&#8221; she wrote, &#8220;Their solution and response was to have him and his bully sign a no-contact contract. Seriously?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Drew decided to stand up for himself.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-195838" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/r39hyXUFzAPsF4bMrYku.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="644" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/r39hyXUFzAPsF4bMrYku.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/r39hyXUFzAPsF4bMrYku-300x189.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/r39hyXUFzAPsF4bMrYku-768x483.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;When this kid threatened Drew (while on the bus) and then moved on to making fun of his Dad and then threatening Jackson, his 11-year-old brother, Drew decided that he would quit relying on the school and the adults who are supposed to protect him and HE would do something,&#8221; his mother writes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Drew was the one who suffered through it.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-195846" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mom-Goes-Viral-After-Defending-Her-Son-For-Beating-Up-His-Bully_3.gif" alt="" width="595" height="449" /></p>
<p>Once a bully learns about the lack of consequences, they begin to escalate the abuse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">&#8220;Three punches and his bully screamed like a baby.&#8221;</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-195840" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/g0GnmTTPDUrhG1LQ6k8V.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/g0GnmTTPDUrhG1LQ6k8V.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/g0GnmTTPDUrhG1LQ6k8V-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;His minion friends shut up, and this morning the bully wouldn’t even look at him,&#8221; Davis continued, &#8220;Problem solved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since Davis posted her lengthy explanation in support of her son, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157740586851322&amp;set=pb.651071321.-2207520000..&amp;type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the post</a> has received almost half a million likes and shares.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Most commenters agreed with Davis&#8217; stance.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-195843" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/g4wSFgGYyTOV6MSJDDua.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/g4wSFgGYyTOV6MSJDDua.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/g4wSFgGYyTOV6MSJDDua-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The boy did what he had to do,&#8221; one person wrote, &#8221; Shame on that school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>She didn&#8217;t point fingers or name the bully.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-195847" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Mom-Goes-Viral-After-Defending-Her-Son-For-Beating-Up-His-Bully_4.gif" alt="" width="648" height="362" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I personally don&#8217;t think you owe it to anyone to justify or clarify what you wrote,&#8221; another person wrote, &#8220;Especially since you didn&#8217;t even name the other kid/kids. You and Mike were protecting your child and then Drew ended up putting a stop to some ridiculous behavior. Period.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What are your thoughts on Davis backing up her son?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-195842" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OTAaWsy25fxccf46unNf.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OTAaWsy25fxccf46unNf.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/OTAaWsy25fxccf46unNf-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>It is nice to see a parent show their support for their child online, even if they think she is condoning violence.</p>
