			<p>Graduation is the most awaited and joyous occasion in everyone&#8217;s life. It&#8217;s an overwhelming phase and one would always want to celebrate it with their families.</p>
<p>A teen with special needs just got graduated and his family couldn&#8217;t be prouder. But still, there&#8217;s one thing he misses. His mother. It was a huge accomplishment in his life and eagerly wanted to celebrate with his mother.</p>
<p>Against his wish, PJ Marshall couldn&#8217;t be with his mother, LaTanya Wilson Marshall, on his graduation day. In 2010, PJ&#8217;s mother passed away. If his mother would be still alive, she would be so proud of her son&#8217;s accomplishment.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, PJ wanted to share his day with his mother. So he visited his mother&#8217;s grave to tell her the wonderful news. He wanted to look his best. He dressed up in slacks, a shirt, and a tie.</p>

<p>On reaching, he stood in front of his mother&#8217;s grave and put a bouquet beside her tombstone. He said, &#8220;Mommy, I have something to say. I did it. I graduated today and I know you’re so proud of me and happy. I love you so much.”</p>
<p>Before leaving her grave, he kissed his mother&#8217;s tombstone. It would have been difficult for him to not have his mother with him on his graduation day. Visiting his mother&#8217;s grave took a load off him.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a video from his visit to his mother&#8217;s grave. Ultimately, you would be shedding some tears.</p>
<p>Most of us take our family for granted. Everyone should take an opportunity to celebrate even a small occasion with their families. PJ has shown us that it&#8217;s important for us to make time for our loved ones, even when they are no longer around us. At least they would be in our hearts forever.</p>

<p>LaTanya raised a precious gem. He&#8217;s growing into an idol man. PJ taught us the true meaning of love and we can never thank him enough.</p>
<p>All in all, we would like to congratulate PJ on his graduation. His internet family is very proud of him!</p>
