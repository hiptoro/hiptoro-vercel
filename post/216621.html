			<p>Hilarie Burton is probably not going to watch Candace Cameron Bure&#8217;s new Christmas movie when it comes out later this month on the Great American Family (GAF) channel. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Bure talked about why she left the Hallmark Channel after ten years to join a different network that was more in line with her religious beliefs.</p>
<p>&#8220;My heart wants to tell stories that have more meaning and purpose and depth behind them,&#8221; Bure, 46, said. &#8220;I knew that the people behind Great American Family were Christians that love the Lord and wanted to promote faith programming and good family entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burton called Bure a &#8220;bigot&#8221; after reading a headline about an interview with a former Full House cast member.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember Jesus liking hypocrites like Candy,&#8221; the <em>One Tree Hill </em>star tweeted. &#8220;But sure. Make your money, honey. You ride that prejudice wave all the way to the bank.&#8221;</p>

<p>JoJo Siwa has added her opinion to the discussion about what Bure said. During the summer, they got into a public fight because the 19-year-old former Dancing With the Stars contestant called Bure the &#8220;rudest&#8221; celebrity she had ever met.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t believe after everything that went down just a few months ago, that she would not only create a movie with intention of excluding LGBTQIA+, but then also talk about it in the press,&#8221; Siwa, who <a class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/jo-jo-siwa-gay-icon-misconceptions-lesbian-culture-queer-girly-lgbtq-190049232.html" data-ylk="slk:came out as gay;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" data-rapid_p="31" data-v9y="1">came out as gay</a> earlier this year, wrote. &#8220;This is rude and hurtful to a whole community of people.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216622" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/315609895_9250355244989951_2644938714563979926_n.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="1800" /></p>
<p>It seems like Bure&#8217;s controversial quote was a response to something she said about how GAF makes shows about &#8220;traditional&#8221; relationships. Now that new people are in charge of Hallmark, the company has been moving toward telling stories with a more modern view. This will be the season that The Holiday Sitter comes out. It is the first original holiday movie made by the network that has LGBTQ characters in a love story. Hallmark called Bure the unofficial queen of Christmas, but she left the company in the same year that GAF started to change its name.</p>
<p>The WSJ asked Bure to talk about why she left the Hallmark Channel. She turned down the interview and only said: &#8220;It basically is a completely different network than when I started because of the change of leadership.&#8221;</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>On the other hand, Bure has said that same-sex couples won&#8217;t be given a lot of attention at her new home. &#8220;It basically is a completely different network than when I started because of the change of leadership.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is what a spokesperson for Hallmark had to say about the situation. She said that the company wants to tell many different kinds of stories, including: &#8220;We want all viewers to see themselves in our programming and everyone is welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you follow Bure on social media, you shouldn&#8217;t be surprised by what she said. The former co-host of The View talks about her Christian faith openly and in public on all of her social media platforms, both in a literal and figurative way. You can even buy a Bible with her name and picture on it from Candace Cameron Bure.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>When she said she was leaving Hallmark, Bure said in a statement that she would be joining Great American Media (GAM), which is the parent company of GAF, because it &#8220;fits my brand perfectly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very excited to develop heartwarming family and faith-filled programming and make the kind of stories my family and I love to watch. I am constantly looking for ways that I can inspire people to live life with purpose,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We share a vision of creating compelling wholesome content for an audience who wants to watch programming for and with the whole family. Great, quality entertainment with a positive message is what my partnership with [GAM] is all about,&#8221; Bure added.</p>
