			<p>Haha! We know that you&#8217;re already laughing after reading the heading. We all know women love shopping the most. And from the times when online shopping came in trend, we always see our ladies swiping their mobile screens to order something new every day. And we are astonished to see them collecting parcels each day. But you&#8217;ll be more surprised to know that a husband has dared to gift his wife a birthday cake shaped like her favorite thing, i.e. the Amazon parcel.</p>
<p>Emily McGuire admitted that she was a proud and frequent Amazon shopper. The mother of three also told that she receives at least two to three brown parcels in a week. Being a shopaholic, she even hides some of them from her husband, Waylon. When Emily&#8217;s birthday was approaching, her husband thought of doing something creative this time. Thus, he ordered a customized birthday cake that looked exactly like an Amazon package.</p>
<h3>The custom creation completely resembled her weekly orders. It had a personalized shipping label and Amazon Prime tape.</h3>
