			<p>A source says that Keanu Reeves has spoken out about what Matthew Perry said about him in his new book.</p>
<p>Perry&#8217;s new book, &#8220;Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,&#8221; came out on Tuesday. It mostly talks about the &#8220;Friends&#8221; star&#8217;s battle with addiction and his journey to recovery. According to a source, the actor wrote in his memoir about how, when he was 49, his opioid use caused his colon to burst and he nearly died.</p>
<p>But the book also talks about and tells stories about other famous people, some of whom have died of drug overdoses. Variety and The Sunday Times published parts of Perry&#8217;s book in which he talked about the early deaths of River Phoenix, Chris Farley, and Heath Ledger and the book also mentioned Reeves twice.</p>
<blockquote><p>River was a beautiful man, inside and out â€” too beautiful for this world, it turned out,</p></blockquote>
<p>Perry wrote.</p>
<blockquote><p>It always seems to be the really talented guys who go down. Why is it that the original thinkers like River Phoenix and Heath Ledger die, but Keanu Reeves still walks among us?</p></blockquote>

<p>Reeves, who is best known for his roles in &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; and &#8220;John Wick,&#8221; paid attention to what was said.</p>
<p>A source said that Reeves thought Perry&#8217;s comments were &#8220;out of the blue,&#8221; but that they &#8220;backfired&#8221; after Perry said he was sorry.</p>
<p>In a statement to a source, Perry said he was sorry and that he is &#8220;actually a big fan of Keanu&#8221; and that he just picked &#8220;a random name.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>My mistake. I apologize,</p></blockquote>
<p>he said.</p>
<blockquote><p>I should have used my own name instead.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perry and Reeves&#8217; representatives were contacted for comment, but they did not respond right away.</p>
