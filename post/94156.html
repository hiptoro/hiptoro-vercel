			<p>Sometimes a little incident here and there is enough to give us a smile and make our day. Something like that happened to Mum Lynn Staffieri.</p>
<p>Lynn was left baffled when she witnessed an Amazon delivery driver sprint away from her home in footage recorded by her front door camera.</p>
<p>She had received a notification through her Nest doorbell while she was out that somebody had been to the door, and the device also sends her footage for home-monitoring and security.</p>
<p>The video she was sent had no audio, but when she returned home she reviewed the full clip to work out why the driver had fled so quickly after the &#8216;weird&#8217; incident in Delaware.</p>
<p>And she quickly learned her young son had been behind it, having snuck a very unique set of delivery instructions onto the Amazon order.</p>
<p>Before the order went out for delivery, under a box titled &#8216;Do we need any additional instructions to find this address?&#8217;, her son had written: &#8220;No but knock on the door 3 times and scream Abracadabra as loud as you can and run super fast away.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-94160" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/0_Amazon-driver-follows-hilarious-delivery-instructions-to-the-letter-1.jpg" alt="" width="615" height="696" /></p>
<p>Incredibly, the clip shows the woman place the package on the porch before banging on the door and screaming the magical phrase before jumping down the steps and sprinting back to her van &#8211; exactly as instructed.</p>
<p>The video now has nearly two million views and 28,000 shares after Lynn posted it on Facebook, along with a screenshot of her son&#8217;s instructions, with the caption: &#8220;Thank you to this great Amazon delivery woman!</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently, my youngest son had put some &#8216;additional instructions&#8217; for delivery and she went along with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It made us smile even though my son should not have done that so I apologize for that.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do appreciate that the driver looked closely enough at the instructions though because I know a lot of people wouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thousands of people praised the driver for her full commitment to the job. Amidst protests regarding Jeff Bezos and Amazon, this incident does lighten the mood a little.</p>
