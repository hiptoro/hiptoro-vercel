			<p>Certain rules and expectation are set wrong about the dating world in general. Men are expected to insist on paying the full bill. While in some areas, it is treated as an insult. The rules of dating can be a bit complex and unreal for the millennials. They are practical in their approach and think that the dating world rules are cliche. Today, we are here to share with you a story which you can relate to the Hollywood movies. Remember how it is portrayed that a women  can only be with a guy for the sake of his money, well, you will see just how it happens in real life.</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">As user CuteBananaMuffin shared on Reddit, a first date did not go as well as he thought it did, and he found that out the hard way.</h2>
<figure id="attachment_126579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-126579" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-126579 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-45.jpg" alt="" width="586" height="827" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-45.jpg 586w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-45-213x300.jpg 213w" sizes="(max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-126579" class="wp-caption-text">He seems to have thought it would be fine to let his date pay for her share of the meal, but her texts to him definitely show that she felt otherwise.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">She clearly expected him to pay for the whole deal, even though her share was vastly more expensive than his.</h2>
<figure id="attachment_126580" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-126580" style="width: 577px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-126580 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-42.jpg" alt="" width="577" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-42.jpg 577w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-42-300x243.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-126580" class="wp-caption-text">For the record, the 110 euros he claims her food and wine came to translates to about $126 U.S. at present. It&#8217;s easy to see where someone might think she was trying to take advantage of him, and the fact that she&#8217;s content calling him rude for not paying so much is a telling sign that there might be some trouble with entitlement down the road.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">Another red flag for this dinner date — apparently she spent much of the night talking about another guy.</h2>
<figure id="attachment_126581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-126581" style="width: 580px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-126581 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-43.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="913" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-43.jpg 580w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-43-191x300.jpg 191w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-126581" class="wp-caption-text">And yet he stayed. As he explained in the thread, at the time the bill for dinner arrived, &#8220;She was shocked&#8221; that he let her pay for her own dinner: &#8220;She didn&#8217;t say anything at the time, but from her facial expression I realized she was furious.&#8221;</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">The reactions generally came down on his side, as you might imagine.</h2>

<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">Folks figured he pretty much dodged a bullet when he let her pay for her lobster dinner and didn&#8217;t let her push him around.</h2>

<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">Some people speculated on ways this kind of behavior might creep its way into other parts of daily life.</h2>

<p>Dark-Castle agreed, saying &#8220;Shes [sic] the kind of person who refuses to get a job, stays at home watching netflix all day, and gets pissed when you come home from your 10hr shift and forget to pick her up some takeout and clean the dishes for her.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">And there were others who were able to see the bright side of it all, that people like her tend to be quite rare.</h2>

<p>&#8220;Eh whatcha gonna do about it? Some women give women a bad name, some men give men a bad name. Luckily we are intelligent enough to understand that they are a small minority of the people,&#8221; wrote rolgordijn.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, when is the last time you ever met someone like this? For me I don’t even remember how long ago it was. All is still well, have a great day!&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">One person suggested that there is an unwritten rule about dating: that whoever does the inviting does the paying.</h2>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s a man or woman or whoever,&#8221; wrote DrJohnnySarcasm. &#8220;If I invite you, I pay. Isn&#8217;t this like common sense?&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">However, not everyone agreed, with some suggesting that was more of a regional thing.</h2>
<div style="width: 480px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-0-5" width="480" height="288" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9.mp4?_=5" /><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9.mp4">https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&#8220;I live in Sweden, and here you basically always pay for your own stuff,&#8221; shared rollingForInitiative. &#8220;That&#8217;s the default. Someone can <em>offer</em> to pay for the other person, but it&#8217;s not expected.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">Well, maybe not in Sweden, but perhaps in Spain.</h2>
<div style="width: 480px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-0-6" width="480" height="480" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/10.mp4?_=6" /><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/10.mp4">https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/10.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>LaOptimista said they found a difference after moving to Spain. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t until I moved to Spain that I realized this was a thing and actually I had to be careful if I invited someone to go for a meal or something. One of the meanings of &#8216;invitar&#8217; in Spanish actually is &#8216;to pay someone else&#8217;s consumption.&#8217; So I have started to invite people without using the actual word.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">But at least one woman chimed in to say that she never expected guys to pay for her meals on dates.</h2>

<p>&#8220;I’m a girl and I always go into the mindset tht [sic] I pay for my drinks/food with anyone,&#8221; wrote princessarielmama. &#8220;Guy or girl and if they offer to pay I’ll let them but offer to pay theirs next time we go out. Even when I was single I never assumed a guy would pay for me dating or not.&#8221;</p>
