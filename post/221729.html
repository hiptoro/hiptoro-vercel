			<p>If you thought you were petty before, Lana Del Rey just stepped it up a notch.</p>
<p>The singer has started promoting her upcoming album <strong>Did You Know That There&#8217;s A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd</strong>, but you can only find a billboard in one US town.</p>
<p>Lana Del Rey doesn&#8217;t want to advertise her album all over the country, even in the most populated cities and tourist spots. Instead, she only wants to do so in Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Why? Because it&#8217;s where her ex-boyfriend lives.</p>
<p>Legendary.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=221731" rel="attachment wp-att-221731"><img data-dominant-color="c8bbb9" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #c8bbb9;" decoding="async" class="not-transparent aligncenter size-full wp-image-221731" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/resize_2-19.webp" alt="Lana Del Ray" width="648" height="338" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/resize_2-19.webp 648w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/resize_2-19-300x156.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" /></a></p>
<p>Fans who follow Lana&#8217;s private Instagram account have shared a selfie she posted of herself in front of the billboard with the caption,</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s only one and it&#8217;s in Tulsa</p></blockquote>
<p>along with a skull emoji.</p>
<p>And if that wasn&#8217;t clear enough, she added in the comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s. Personal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lana&#8217;s ex-boyfriend, Sean Larkin, is from Tulsa, Oklahoma. He is a police officer-turned-reality star who was on A&amp;E&#8217;s docuseries Live PD from 2019 to 2020.</p>
<p>People say that the couple dated for six months and spent time in both Los Angeles and Tulsa.</p>
<p>After their red carpet debut at the pre-Grammy gala in 2020, Lana Del Rey took him to the Grammys with her.</p>
<p>In the end, though, the couple broke up later that same year.</p>
<p>At the time, it seemed like the couple broke up on good terms. Sean said,</p>
<blockquote><p>We still talk and whatnot, we just have busy schedules right now.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=221730" rel="attachment wp-att-221730"><img data-dominant-color="2e2828" data-has-transparency="false" style="--dominant-color: #2e2828;" decoding="async" class="not-transparent aligncenter size-full wp-image-221730" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/resize-19.webp" alt="Lana Del Ray" width="648" height="971" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/resize-19.webp 648w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/resize-19-200x300.webp 200w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" /></a></p>
<p>Fans went crazy when Lana Del Rey told them that her next album would be promoted in a petty way.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lana Del Rey putting up just one billboard for her album in her ex boyfriend&#8217;s city and then posting about it is so Lana Del Rey,</p></blockquote>
<p>tweeted one fan.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lana Del Rey putting up 1 billboard to promote her new album, in Tulsa Oklahoma, where her ex lives, is the type of petty that I LIVE for,</p></blockquote>
<p>raved a second.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lana Del Rey is so real for that billboard in Tulsa cause iâ€™d do the same,</p></blockquote>
<p>admitted a third.</p>
<p>And a fourth commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Lana Del Rey put the one f***ing billboard in Tulsa. Idc if you like her or not that is hilarious.</p></blockquote>
<p>To make matters worse, Lana took a cue from her good friend Taylor Swift and announced the album and track titles on Sean Larkin&#8217;s birthday, December 7.</p>
<p>If this promo is any indication, the album will be scandalously good when it comes out in March 2023.</p>
