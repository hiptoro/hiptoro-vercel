			Mom Goes Viral With TikTok Where She Explains the Sad Reality of “Daddy Privilege”
		  </h1>
			<img src='https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/privilege.png' />
			<p>No matter what we say or what we do, in the world we live in, dads are always heroes. And it&#8217;s not fair. After all, when a mom does everything for her baby, we think it&#8217;s her responsibility. But when dad does the bare minimum, we call them a hero.</p>
<p>Regarding the same thing, a TikToker tried explaining the sad reality of “daddy privilege.” Chloe Sexton, the TikToker coined “daddy privilege” after her husband experienced it. She is the mother of a 6-month-old named Theodore and a 7-year-old named Mason. Also, she runs a bakery called <a href="https://www.bluffcakes.com/">BluffCakes</a> in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-180104" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-4.png" alt="" width="671" height="833" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-4.png 671w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-4-242x300.png 242w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-4-445x552.png 445w" sizes="(max-width: 671px) 100vw, 671px" /></p>
<p>Since both Chloe and her husband works, she keeps Theodore with her. Even when she has to purchase wholesale ingredients for her bakery, she takes her child.</p>
<p>Also, before Theodore, she was pregnant when she went. “I’m, like, wearing him (Theodore) or was massively pregnant buying 400 pounds of flour and 100 pounds of butter, and that’s a weekly thing. The list goes on and on, like — it’s a lot,” she says in her TikTok.</p>
<p>So, this one time, her husband decided to take a day off to help Chloe. Sweet, right?</p>
<p>But Chloe was shocked when the store staff treated her husband differently for the same work that she has been doing for years.</p>
<p>“When I tell you, the way that this man was treated like a hero — A HERO,” she says. “Mind you, those same people see me there every single week.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-180105" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-3.png" alt="" width="672" height="842" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-3.png 672w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-3-239x300.png 239w" sizes="(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px" /></p>
<p>“I’m strapped up with a baby or seven months pregnant, hauling 100-pound bags at a time of flour in the back of my Subaru. Meanwhile, I’m getting a whole lotta…NOTHING TO SEE HERE. Just a woman doing woman things, busting her ass,” she says. “But my husband, my husband wears the baby and he goes to Restaurant Depot for mommy’s business and it’s, ‘Oh my god, look at you! Oh my god, you work so hard.’”</p>
<p>“He’s literally not a hero. He’s just a father, just a parent, doing the same shit I do every week,” she said.</p>

<p>The video racked up almost a million likes, with so many moms feeling the same way.</p>
<p>“Greatness is expected of women but are somehow never appreciated for it,” someone wrote.</p>
<p>“Absolutely insane how people act toward dads just being a parent,” another agreed.</p>
<p>“I went to go do my nails and they asked who was watching the kids, I said dad/husband. And they’re like ‘that’s so nice of him.’ NO THAT’S HIS JOB,” another said.</p>
