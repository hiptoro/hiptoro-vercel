			<p>People want to know what&#8217;s going on in the lives of the celebrities they look up to because when they walk the red carpet and smile for dozens of cameras, they look like the happiest people in the world. But once the event is over, many famous people go home, take off their smiles, and realize that fame makes them live a life that isn&#8217;t really theirs. This is what Ricky Martin found himself doing. The man who was loved by millions of people had trouble feeling alone for a long time. But at one point, he changed everything that needed to be changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The most handsome person in the whole world.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216978" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/727a145645901e3749ade0051b.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="545" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/727a145645901e3749ade0051b.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/727a145645901e3749ade0051b-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Ricky Martin has been on stage ever since he was a child. Even though he was only 12, he was already performing on stage and touring with the boy band Menudo. At the age of 19, he became a soap opera star, and at the age of 26, he was called &#8220;the most attractive man in the world&#8221; on the cover of a glossy magazine. Both of these things happened to him before he was 26 years old. The year 1997 was when it happened. Over the next few decades, the singer was voted either the sexiest or most attractive man dozens of times. They <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Martin#Public_image:~:text=%22Ricky%20looks%20like%20the%20model%20in%20the%20magazine%20ads%20you%20stare%20at%20in%20awe%20thinking%2C%20%27There%27s%20no%20way%20he%27s%20that%20perfect%20in%20person%27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">said</a> about him,</p>
<blockquote><p>Ricky looks like the model in the magazine ads you stare at in awe thinking, ‘There’s no way he’s that perfect in person.’</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216977" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/d2ade6521ea0ccc9ac9522d996.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="755" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/d2ade6521ea0ccc9ac9522d996.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/d2ade6521ea0ccc9ac9522d996-289x300.jpg 289w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Even though most people thought he was one of the most popular singers in the world, no one has ever questioned his skills. On the other hand, many journalists have said that he is a very talented singer with &#8220;a beautiful soul&#8221; as well as a great voice. Everyone was definitely interested in what this &#8220;Latin heartthrob&#8221; did in his free time.</p>
<p>Martin tried hard for many years to avoid talking about this sensitive subject because of how complicated the situation was. He met the man who would later become his boyfriend when he was working at a radio station. Ricky&#8217;s mother knew what was going on and was there for him the whole time. Even so, the relationship didn&#8217;t last long, and the singer kept his feelings to himself because he wasn&#8217;t ready to tell the rest of the world he liked other men.</p>
<blockquote><p>I already felt it was hard to be a Latino in Hollywood; what could have been more difficult than being Latino and gay?</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The ladies&#8217; man.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216976" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4fc5db56409ca1ae314ff29297.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="591" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4fc5db56409ca1ae314ff29297.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4fc5db56409ca1ae314ff29297-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>But even the most attractive man in the world can break a woman&#8217;s heart. Ricky was 21 years old when this happened. The woman he loved was now with someone else and had left him. The woman was the Mexican singer Alejandra Guzmán. In an interview many years later, she said that Martin&#8217;s mother didn&#8217;t like her, which is why the two of them had to hide their relationship.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216975" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/9aaea657628cad53274fe59ef5.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="591" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/9aaea657628cad53274fe59ef5.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/9aaea657628cad53274fe59ef5-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the media never stopped writing about Ricky Martin&#8217;s relationships with different women. You could say that this happened for a reason. Ricky Martin was joined on the red carpet at the event by a number of beautiful women. Gabriela Sabatini, a tennis player, Alessandra Ambrosio, a supermodel, and Ines Misan, an actress, were all there.</p>
<p>During this time, his longest relationship was with the Mexican TV host Rebecca de Alba. The two people&#8217;s relationship kept breaking up and getting back together. After going through this for 10 years and losing a pregnancy, they decided to end their relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>His self-acceptance.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216974" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/b847ff5d7f8e8d43e4a3306332.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="728" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/b847ff5d7f8e8d43e4a3306332.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/b847ff5d7f8e8d43e4a3306332-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/b847ff5d7f8e8d43e4a3306332-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/b847ff5d7f8e8d43e4a3306332-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Ricky, who was 37 at the time, made the decision to become a single parent because he was unable to find a life partner. Surrogacy allowed him to become a father to identical twins. This was a major turning point in the singer&#8217;s life. He wanted both Matteo and Valentino to like what he had done. Because of this, Martin had to be honest with himself and accept who he really was.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216973" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/e428fe51b4bd225c3d68696929.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="692" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/e428fe51b4bd225c3d68696929.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/e428fe51b4bd225c3d68696929-300x285.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Years went by, and the singer couldn&#8217;t come to terms with the idea that he might be gay. He didn&#8217;t give honest answers to the questions the journalists asked him because he didn&#8217;t know the answers himself. Other than that, he thought that if he told people he was gay, everything in his life would fall apart. He used to make fun of people like this, but now he was one of them. In a statement that was posted on his website, he said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am proud to say that I am a fortunate homosexual man. I am very blessed to be who I am.</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216972" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/c399d854908a57c79c956a9cf2.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="626" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/c399d854908a57c79c956a9cf2.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/c399d854908a57c79c956a9cf2-300x258.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Even though he was afraid, the world was still there when he came out of the cave the next morning. On the other hand, his followers liked how real he was, and many of them were inspired to accept themselves, too. Ricky <a href="https://www.out.com/out-exclusives/2018/1/09/exclusive-ricky-martin-and-edgar-ramirez-talk-love-death-and-gianni-versace#:~:text=%E2%80%9CI%20want%20people%20to%20look%20at%20me%20and%20see%20a%20family%20and%20say%2C%20%E2%80%98There%E2%80%99s%20nothing%20wrong%20with%20that." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">wrote</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>I want people to look at me and see a family and say, ‘There’s nothing wrong with that.’</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the singer made it clear that his relationships with women were not acts or lies to hide who he really was. He liked and respected each of them very much.</p>
<blockquote><p>You can’t fake chemistry,</p></blockquote>
<p>Martin <a href="https://people.com/music/ricky-martin-wont-hide-anymore-man-with-no-secrets-pride-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">says</a>. We don&#8217;t live in a black-and-white world; instead, it&#8217;s full of color, which can make it hard to understand at times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The much-anticipated wedding.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216971" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/6714fe5c02a646f100b8f25466.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="498" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/6714fe5c02a646f100b8f25466.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/6714fe5c02a646f100b8f25466-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Ricky Martin was 45 years old when he finally met the person who would become his life partner. The singer went to the gallery of the artist Jwan Yosef and fell in love with his work. He didn&#8217;t find the artist&#8217;s photo until a long time afterward. Before they finally met in person, the two sent each other text messages for six months. When Ricky saw Jwan for the first time, he knew right away that he wanted to marry him.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216970" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/8988865bb781c02b8ca880b7ab.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="910" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/8988865bb781c02b8ca880b7ab.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/8988865bb781c02b8ca880b7ab-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>And he could see his dream come true. In 2017, Ricky and Jwan tied the knot. After taking in Martin&#8217;s kids, the artist and his partner had their own two kids right away. This big family has bought more real estate and now has homes in both the U.S. and Puerto Rico. On the other hand, the popular Latin singer says,</p>
<blockquote><p>Our kids are stable when we are together. Wherever we happen to be, that’s home.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you ever felt like you loved someone the moment you saw them? How did you know that what you were feeling was love if that&#8217;s the case?</p>
