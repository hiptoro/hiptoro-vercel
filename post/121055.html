			<h2><strong>Dogs don’t know what ‘too big to hold’ means.</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dogs are so adorable. Like they are the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">itty bitty puppies you want to hold forever. But they grow up so fast and then, you can’t hold ‘em. However, this does not stop us from loving them the way we used to do when they were young. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, our big furry angels don’t understand that they have grown too big. Probably, that’s why they still want to be on our lap all the time. And we don’t seem to have a problem with it. After all, we love them a lot. But there is one thing we want to say. When you are holding your big puppies, make sure that you are wearing your steal-boned back support so you won’t hurt yourself. We are not joking. </span></p>
