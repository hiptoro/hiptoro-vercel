			<p>Everyone has the right to express themselves. But sometimes, it feels like certain people should not be allowed to speed. That&#8217;s because they are asking so stupid that we fail to understand their intelligence.</p>
<p>A now-deleted Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l8pnun/whats_the_dumbest_thing_youve_ever_been_asked_by/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">asked</a> everyone on the platform to share the dumbest things people have asked them. And they succeeded: the comment section was flooded with ridiculous submissions, stemming from ignorance in subjects like geography, religion, and the human body.</p>

About 25 years ago I was explaining time zones to a 20ish year old intern at a large scientific agency. She wasn&#8217;t getting it, so i got an orange I brought for lunch and used it as the Earth.</p>
<p>Me: Ok, pretend this is the Earth. The sun only shines on one side, so it&#8217;s day on approximately half at any given time. Now since the Earth rotates (as i spin the orange)&#8230;</p>
<p>Intern: So wait. Hold on. So you&#8217;re saying the Earth is round?</p>
<p>I wish i was joking.</p>

&#8220;If you&#8217;re an atheist, why don&#8217;t you go around killing people?&#8221; I&#8217;m worried now that there are people out there who would just casually kill, but don&#8217;t because they&#8217;re scared of hell.</p>

Why are you spying on me?</p>
<p>I was working in a call center for Dish Network and a guy called in, very upset. He wanted to know why Dish Network was spying on him. I tried to let him know that we were not in fact spying on him. Which he countered with, &#8220;if you are not spying on me then why is there a camera in the damn box?&#8221; &#8220;Sir, a camera? There is no camera in the receiver&#8221; I respond. &#8220;Yes there is&#8221; he screams &#8220;I know there is because I can see everything happening in my room on the TV right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sat there and pondered that statement, trying to figure out what was happening. I asked, &#8220;sir, is your TV off right now?&#8221; In the background I hear the clear sound of a TV being turned on. I then said, &#8220;sir, that is called a reflection. Is there anything else I can help you with?&#8221; He hung up.</p>

I used to be a tour guide in a cave and one summer we had a running contest among the guides to see who could get the dumbest question. Keep in mind, we only accepted questions from adults for entry into the contest. Some of the finalists were:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this cave underground?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will the stalagmites bite me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are the steps natural?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What time is the 4.30 tour?&#8221;</p>
<p>And the winner: &#8220;Does the water go all the way around the island?&#8221;</p>

Holding my cat while outside. “Is that a cat?” “Why yes, yes it is”</p>
<h2>19.</h2>
<p>I had the neighbors by for a quick chat a few years ago, and we happened to be standing by our goat pen, we had three at the time. For whatever reason, people don&#8217;t really see goats as pets, and I&#8217;m often asked about their purpose, are they meat, etc.</p>
<p>Well, this guy asked if I milked them. I explained that they&#8217;re all retired breeding males.</p>
<p>He followed that up by asking again if we milk them, and was so affronted by the look I could not help giving him that he left in a huff. I didn&#8217;t mean to be rude, but I definitely looked at him as if he were an idiot and he was smart enough, at least, to figure that out.</p>
