			<p>You probably remember how nervous you were before your first child was born. Nothing can prepare you for being a parent until you are a parent. It is a learning job.</p>
<p>Being responsible for the life of a baby is a big deal. It can be exciting and overwhelming at the same time.</p>
<p>Before the child is conceived, numerous mothers-to-be go through a settling stage where they need everything in the house and the child&#8217;s space to be set up flawlessly and all set. Planning for another child can likewise incorporate babyproofing the whole house and maybe working on your propensities to make the climate a more secure spot, like not wearing shoes in the house and attempting to overcome a smoking vice (ideally not with respect to the mother-to-be since you most certainly ought not to be smoking while pregnant).</p>
<p>One mom-to-be shared on Slate that her in-laws will visit after the baby is born. Although she doesn&#8217;t think her mother-in-law will smoke around the baby, she is still concerned about the effects of thirdhand smoke.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve most likely known about handed-down cigarette smoke. In the event that you&#8217;ve at any point strolled down the walkway close to somebody who&#8217;s smoking, you&#8217;ve inhaled it in, yet thirdhand smoke isn&#8217;t also known. Essentially, after somebody smokes, the smoke&#8217;s abandoned on clothing, on surfaces, and in the residue. Assuming that you&#8217;ve at any point visited the home of somebody who smokes, in any event, when they&#8217;re not smoking, the house presumably still scents like smoke. Why? Since the smoke is waiting all over. This is thirdhand smoke.</p>
<p>If her mother-in-law smokes, this mom-to-be wants her to shower and change clothes so she can hold or touch her baby. It makes complete sense, even though it might seem a little extreme.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>The answer she received on Slate states that “you are perfectly within your rights to ask for what you want; her response to that is her business, not yours.”  She can ask her mother-in-law to shower and change clothes when her mother-in-law is visiting, but it&#8217;s tricky when the new family visits the in-laws. It is not possible to enforce strict rules when it is not your home. The advice was to stay in a hotel.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of thirdhand smoke? Do you think it is crazy to have the mother-in-law shower and change clothes before holding the baby? If you were the mother-in-law, what would you do?</p>
