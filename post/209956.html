			<p>The rumors about Amber Heard&#8217;s involvement in &#8220;Aquaman 2&#8221; have resurfaced in the wake of the shocking changes made to the original&#8230;</p>
<p>Following the shocking alterations to the upcoming sequel&#8217;s official release, speculation about Amber Heard&#8217;s involvement in &#8220;Aquaman 2&#8221; has surfaced once more.</p>
<p>Despite a challenging legal battle with Johnny Depp, Elon Musk&#8217;s ex-girlfriend was retained for the franchise.</p>
<p>However, it is currently unknown what her future in the DC broader universe entails.</p>
<p>Given all the problems she has had and is still having, Amber expressed reluctance about returning throughout the trial and cited Warner Bros.</p>
<p>Director James Wan and star Jason Momoa fought to have the actress appear in Aquaman Two.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she has continued to serve as Mira, but that is about to change.</p>
<p>Emilia Clarke, also known as Mother of Dragons or Mother of Dragons from Game of Thrones, is set to succeed Amber.</p>
<p>When and why did Warner Bros. decide to finally replace Amber?</p>
<p>Find out by watching the video below.</p>
<p>Speaking about finally replacing Amber in Aquaman 2, Emilia Clarke</p>
