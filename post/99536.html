			<p>Over the past few years, dog pics and videos have become quite popular among netizens. And thus, we came to know about overweight dogs. Just as humans, dogs are also very much prone to obesity.</p>
<p>Pet obesity is quite a serious issue as it can invite so many kinds of health problems. And we know you would never want that for your furry friend because you love them, right? So if your little pup has gained a few extra pounds, do something immediately.</p>
