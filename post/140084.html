			<h2><strong>Relationships can be complicated.</strong></h2>
<p>Today, what do you think is your relationship status with anyone in your life. Would you agree, that society has set characteristics specific to genders?  Relationships are complicated and so is the expectation that is attached to them. The stereotypical mentality, that men have to take the first step to approach a woman belongs to the yesteryears. An evident example of people believing in this idea was a post on Reddit that we recently came across. So, we would like you all to see what this post had to convey and how did people react to it.</p>
<h2>It isn’t always that easy. Most people are afraid of getting rejected.</h2>

<h2>Why continue with the mind games when you can communicate honestly?</h2>

<p>By the time it’s appropriate, the whole thing has been built up, unfairly, and the moment is usually awkward. People are just genuinely afraid of being let down. It’s a problem that needs to get solved, like yesterday. It’s ok for things to not go right. And if they aren’t, move on. If you have decided not to neatly pack up your sorrow and tow it around in a suitcase behind you for the rest of your life, then there is another moment right around the corner. –<a class="f3THgbzMYccGW8vbqZBUH _23wugcdiaj44hdfugIAlnX " href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Popular-Mushroom9198/">Popular-Mushroom9198</a></p>
