			<p>Someone has correctly said that we must be careful what we wish for. Even if life feels like a fairy tale, we should stick to reality because when we don&#8217;t, most random things can happen.</p>
<p>Here is a similar story of the cat Duchess and her family, who now live in an animated film.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not the first time we’ve been surprised by a cat, but it was definitely a surprise for the owners and a real treat for people on the Internet.</p>
<h2>Recently, photos of this white cat named Duchess went viral on the internet</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187643" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-66.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="614" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-66.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-66-300x263.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>She was adopted by Shelby Sewell-Lopez of Texas. When she was adopted, she was very weak, her hair was falling out, she had a hernia and a lot of parasites. “Throughout her rehabilitation, she kept her behavior calm, and a beautiful cat emerged from it. She’s not upset about anything, except the vacuum cleaner.”</p>
<h2>One day, they found Duchess in a closet with something that at first sight looked like a mouse</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187644" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-69.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="383" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-69.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-69-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Although her new family thought Duchess was spayed, one day they found her in a closet with what they thought was a mouse, but they were wrong.</p>
<h2>It turned out that the mouse was a newborn kitten, and 3 more were born later</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187645" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-67.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="831" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-67.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-67-253x300.jpg 253w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The mouse turned out to be Berlioz, then came Marie and Toulouse. And then came an extra kitten, Blue. “Although Blue is not officially an Aristocat, he is the most loving and steals the most attention.” Despite her rough past, Duchess is a great mother who never abandons her kittens. They even grew up and went to explore the house, but she always went with them. Shelby admits that the cat has become spoiled because she always brings her food and drink to her.</p>
<h2>The owners soon realized that the kittens looked like the characters of the Aristocats</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187646" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-65.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="416" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-65.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-65-300x178.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>They even matched the film in color and gender, so they gave them those names: Marie, Toulouse, and Berlioz.</p>
<h2>And they were inseparable</h2>

<p>Although they decided right away to keep the kittens, it took some persuading Shelby’s husband.</p>

<h2>This is Marie</h2>

<h2>Toulouse</h2>

<h2>And Berlioz</h2>
