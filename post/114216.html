			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somethings are always special and we adore them forever. Like the first time we have started working, the first time we had purchased a house, or the first time we became a parent. Oh, the experience of becoming parents for the first time is very special. And hopefully, a talented Israeli artist named Yehuda Devir has shown the sweet moments perfectly. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When he and his wife, Maya, became parents for the first time, Yehuda tried to illustrate the emotion in a perfect and delicate way. And guess what? He has done it better than anyone else can. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scroll down and get ready to see some of the precious moments that you can perfectly relate to.</span></p>
