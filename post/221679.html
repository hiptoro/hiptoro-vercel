			<p>After five months of pure mystery and confusion, the New York City Medical Examiner has finally unveiled a cause of death for <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/how-did-general-hospital-star-sonya-eddy-die-cause-of-death-revealed/">Charlbi Dean</a>. Popularly known for Robert Ostlund&#8217;s <em>Triangle of Sadness,</em> Charlbi died Monday, August 29, in a New York hospital due to a sudden and unexpected illness as explained by her representative. The 32-year-old actress/model had previously survived a horrific <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/jay-leno-pictured-heading-back-to-garage-10-days-after-he-was-involved-in-a-car-fire-incident/">car accident</a> that resulted in a broken wrist, four ribs, an elbow, and suffered a collapsed lung.</p>
<p>After her death in August, the cause of her death is now public. A spokesperson for the New York City Chief Medical Examiner explained that Dean died due to bacterial sepsis. She suffered sepsis after a &#8220;complication from asplenia&#8221; due to a &#8220;remote blunt trauma to her torso.&#8221; Charlbi&#8217;s brother Alex Jacobs revealed that after her car accident the doctors removed her spleen.</p>

<h2>Charlbi Dean cause of death revealed</h2>
<p>The bacterial sepsis found in the actress is said to have been caused by a bacteria called Capnocytophaga. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that these germs are commonly found living in the mouths of dogs and cats. However, it can spread to people through bites, scratches, or close contact with a dog or cat in rare cases. Capnocytophaga is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria which is normally found in the &#8220;oropharyngeal tract of mammals.&#8221;</p>
<p>While it may not sound too dangerous, it can cause an infection in a person who has a weak immune system. CDC specifically mentions people who drink alcohol excessively, have had their spleens removed, like Charlbi Dean, and have HIV infection or cancer. Capnocytophaga germs can also be found in human mouths and can cause illness in some people who have the bacteria in their own mouths. As for Charlbi, her death was ruled an accident by the coroner. She currently has 225,000 followers on Instgram and her bio reads, &#8220;You know they&#8217;s a kind of bird that don&#8217;t have legs so it can&#8217;t light on nothing but has to stay all its life on its wings in the sky?&#8221;</p>
