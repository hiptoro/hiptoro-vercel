			Influencer Says She's 'Too Hot' to Work a Regular Job

			<p>Lucy Welcher, a young TikTok influencer with more than 80,000 followers, recently shared a video with her fans in which she said she will never get a regular job because she is too pretty.</p>
<blockquote><p>I do not want to work for the rest of my life. Does it look like I want to get up at 6 a.m. every f**king day for the next 60 years?</p></blockquote>
<p>She said in the video.</p>
<p>Her viewers were quick to put her down, calling her lazy and spoiled and saying that she can&#8217;t live in a society without contributing in some way. Even pretty women have no choice but to work.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="TikToker slammed for saying she&#039;s too pretty to work every day" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_uyi9fmSuY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Someone who said their job was worse than Welcher&#8217;s said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Try waking up at 4 a.m. every day working 60 hours a week.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>I hope you get humbled girl, you need it. Looks have to nothing to do with working and it’s sad you have that mentality,</p></blockquote>
<p>another critic chimed in.</p>

<p>Like with most crazy ideas, though, some of her fans quickly agreed with her, saying that beautiful women shouldn&#8217;t have to work regular jobs like everyone else.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sending this to every employer I’ve ever had,</p></blockquote>
<p>one user agreed with her.</p>
<p>One desperate commenter even said,</p>
<blockquote><p>You can be my housewife I make 6 figures a year just make sure the house is clean and food is on the table.</p></blockquote>

<p>After her video went viral on the internet, she said that it was all a &#8220;joke&#8221; and not meant to be taken seriously. But this person with a lot of influence does have a real job. She said she got a promotion recently, but she didn&#8217;t say where she works.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m starting a new position at my job today, so instead of folding towels, I’m going to be on the desk,</p></blockquote>
<p>Welcher said,</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m very nervous to start on the desk because although I may look very beautiful, smart, and talented, I’m not actually smart at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s all for likes and comments and has nothing to do with her real life. She only just made a silly remark on social media.</p>
