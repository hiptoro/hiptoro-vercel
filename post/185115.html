			<p>Julia Roberts, the &#8216;Pretty Woman&#8217; star stumpped her fans in a pretty pink swimwear.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, she hit the beach with her family in Sydney, Australia. The actress wore a bright pink one-piece swimsuit for the beach outing that perfectly highlighted her lean legs and</p>
<p>The actress, 54, highlighted her lean legs and fit figure in a bright pink one-piece swimsuit for the holiday outing. She was joined by her husband, Danny Moder, who flaunted his abs by going shirtless.</p>

<p>The couple took some time away from their busy schedules to spend the holidays together. Paparazzi at one point captured the two taking a sweet stroll along the beach.</p>
<p>Roberts covered up in a paisley pullover dress, while Moder, 52, wore a long-sleeve tee. They both rocked trucker hats to shade their faces from the sun.</p>

<p>The happy couple even showed off a little PDA, when Roberts wrapped her arms around her husband and kissed his neck.</p>
<p>All three of their children were in tow: twins Phinnaeus and Hazel, 17, and Henry, 14.</p>

<p>Roberts has been in Australia for the past few months to shoot her next rom-com, “Ticket to Paradise.”</p>
<p>The Ol Parker-directed film also stars her longtime friend and co-star George Clooney, Kaitlyn Dever, Lucas Bravo and Billie Lourd.</p>

<p>Just one week before the Christmas holiday, Roberts <a href="https://pagesix.com/2021/12/18/julia-roberts-crashes-george-clooneys-interview/">crashed Clooney’s virtual interview</a> for “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” by slowly sliding into frame until she was shoulder-to-shoulder with the actor during the interview.</p>
<p>“George, I don’t know if you’re aware of this, but the woman sitting next to you…,” Kimmel, 54, pointed out, once he realized Roberts had joined the call.</p>

<p>Clooney, 60, was clearly in on the joke, and pretended not to see Roberts.</p>
<p>The actress wore large black sunglasses and stayed silent the entire time she was on screen before eventually sliding back out of view.</p>
<p>“Maybe I hallucinated that,” Kimmel joked. “Wow. It sure looked like Julia Roberts, though.”</p>
