			<p>After spending six hours at the restaurant, a couple left a small 10% tip, which made the waitress very angry.</p>
<p>Kristina Withers posted a clip about what happened on TikTok, and it has since gone viral. She told the audience that the two people had come before she got to work at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>&#8220;My co-worker that gets there at 3 o&#8217;clock had already served them and cashed them out by the time I got there at 5:30 tonight. They were fine, they were chilling. They were good to go. Cashed out, no worries,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Kristina said that they came up to her around 7 p.m. after they hadn&#8217;t ordered food or drinks for more than an hour.</p>
<p>She continued: &#8220;By this time, my co-worker is like already done for the night, so I&#8217;m like OK I&#8217;ll just take your orders since I&#8217;m closing I&#8217;m gonna be here. We&#8217;ll get you some food, we&#8217;ll get you in and out it&#8217;s gonna be good to go nice and easy, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They each get a drink, a glass of wine, and a margarita. They get their food. Two taco plates, easy peasy. They&#8217;re eating the tacos done with the tacos, take their plates.&#8221;</p>

<p>She added: &#8220;Guess who the last motherf**king table in the goddamn restaurant was? These two lovely motherf**kers, that&#8217;s who.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The very best part though was that they didn&#8217;t even tip 20 per cent. They were my only table. I was probably giving them overly good service because they were my only table. I had nothing else to f**king do. I know I have good service to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the same time I&#8217;ve never been more happy to recieve a 10 per cent tip because I knew they were on their way out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her clip did start a discussion about how to tip, and even though the couple stayed at the restaurant for a long time, Kristina didn&#8217;t like that they didn&#8217;t think about how much time they took up.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best part though, the very best part they didn&#8217;t even tip twenty percent,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who sits in a restaurant for six hours,&#8221; one person wondered, while another added: &#8220;If I’m in a section for 6 hours I’d literally tip 200% LMAOOO.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the same time, one said: &#8220;I mean it&#8217;s tip, they actually could no tip and leave&#8221;</p>
