			<p>If you know Owen Wilson, you will agree when we say he has transitioned from playing the womanizing-stud type, as seen in such movies as <em>The Wedding Crashers</em> (2005) to more family roles. Let’s face it, post-<em>Marley &amp; Me (2008). </em></p>
<p>Now, Wilson is over fifty. So, it&#8217;s obvious that he is playing more of dad-like roles. But what about his real life? What about his daughter that we didn&#8217;t know about?</p>
<h2 id="h-yep-owen-wilson-has-a-kid-he-s-never-even-met">Yep, Owen Wilson has a kid he’s never even met …</h2>

<p>And although it’s not like he ever went around boasting that he was the sensitive, present father figure type… he’s been that guy in so many family movies can anyone blame us for assuming so?</p>

<p>Although Wilson has had his fair share of love interests, the actor has never settled down. Wilson now has 3 children to 3 different women.</p>

<p>There’s nothing wrong with having children with multiple partners, so long as you still see each of them and support them as much as you can. The strange thing with the Owen Wilson situation is that he does see his 2 sons. Robert Ford Wilson, born in 2011, and Finn Lindqvist Wilson, born in 2015… It’s just his daughter that he has no interest in having contact with.</p>

<p>When Varunie told Wilson she was pregnant he refused to believe the child was his. The court papers which were seen by <a class="new-window" href="https://radaronline.com/videos/owen-wilson-cut-ties-changed-phone-number-after-learning-ex-girlfriend-varunie-vongsvirates-was-pregnant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RadarOnline </a>revealed how horrendously Wilson treated his ex.</p>

<p>Baby Lyla Aranya Wilson was born on September 10th, 2018. Refusing to accept that he is Lyla’s father, Wilson paid nothing towards Varunie’s medical bills or diapers, baby clothes, bottles, crib, pram… <em>nothing.</em></p>

<p>Luke discusses becoming a dad and says: “I definitely want to start a family. I love my niece and my nephews. And I know how much my dad loved being a father, that was one of the things that made him the most happy, so yeah, I’m forty-seven, I’m ready for that. I need to get to work.” So does Luke see his niece? From the court papers, we know Owen doesn’t.</p>

<p>In the court papers, Varunie Vongsvirates filed for sole parental rights. In earlier papers, Wilson had ticked the box requesting “none” under visitation rights. In his explanation, he wrote that he was “not certain if he is the parent.” But despite now having had a DNA test that proves he is Lyla’s dad he is still not interested in seeing her.</p>

<p>Having lost her mom 2 years ago, Varunie and her sister are extremely close. The mom-of-1 frequently babysits her sister, Ali’s kids. The fact that Lyla is yet to meet her half-siblings and other cousins is an unnecessary tragedy.</p>
