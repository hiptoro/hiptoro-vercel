			<p>What would you do on your 74th birthday? Some might relax but <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/avengers-end-game-spoilers-did-samuel-l-jackson-spoiled-plot-before-release/">Samuel L Jackson</a> had NO CHILL on his day of the year. The 74-year-old actor was caught liking X-rated hardcore porn on his Twitter. Funnily enough, Jackson is not tech savvy which he proved as he did not know that in the new update the likes on <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/hilarious-quotes-from-twitter/">Twitter</a> are now public. Without any realization, the actor went on to like the X-rated content much to fans&#8217; amusement. As a result, Samuel L. Jackson went trending on the platform with fans not wishing but making him aware of his public embarrassment.</p>
<p>The MCU&#8217;s Nick Fury actor is known for hit films like <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, <em>Django Unchained</em>, <em>Coach Carter</em>, Hitman&#8217;s Wife&#8217;s Bodyguard, Kingsman: The Secret Service, The Hateful Eight, Unbreakable, and more. He currently has 9.1 million followers on the Elon Musk-owned platform Twitter. The microblogging platform went WILD once his likes were seen which was full of X-rated content.</p>
<h2>Samuel L. Jackson trends on Twitter after liking PORN</h2>

<p>Jackson previously accepted in a 2017 interview that he watches porn and is a fan of hentai. The only reason why Jackson went trending on Twitter is because of his loyal fans. All they tried to do was warn the actor of this development. But before they knew it, the brass got a whiff of it and Jackson was the talk of the town &#8211; only for hilarious reasons. Not many tweets trolled the actor but his fans claimed that he had all the right in the world to be liking certain NSFW tweets as an adult.</p>
