<p>By Musk paying $11 billion in taxes last year, he gave 0.0036 percent of his earnings away. Yep, it might make you want to cry yourself to sleep, but that’s the truth.</p>

<p>In the interview, the reporter said that Musk could potentially make more money from his Bitcoin investments than with his electric cars in all of 2020, and then she asked for Bill’s opinion on the matter.</p>
<h2 id="h-elon-has-tons-of-money-and-he-s-very-sophisticated-so-i-don-t-worry-that-his-bitcoin-will-randomly-go-up-or-down-he-began">“Elon has tons of money and he’s very sophisticated so I don’t worry that his Bitcoin will randomly go up or down,” he began.</h2>

<p>“I do think people get brought into these manias who may not have as much money to spare so I’m not bullish on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>“My general thought would be if you have less money than Elon you should probably watch out,” he continued on.</p>

Bitcoin happens to use a lot of energy, it happens to promote anonymous transactions, they’re not reversible transactions,” he said.</h2>

<p>He does encourage the move toward digital money, saying eventually that they will reach poorer countries, but, doesn’t believe Bitcoin is all the rave, apparently.</p>

<p>It’s probably best not to invest in Bitcoin.</p>
