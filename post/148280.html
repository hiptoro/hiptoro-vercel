			<p>The life of influencers is not as happening as their social media account represent. In this digital age, nobody knows the bitter reality of life, instead, believe in what people depict themselves to be.  So, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/superfuncity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"><em>superfuncity</em></a> decided to find out what lies beneath the facade.</p>
<p>So, to find out the truth the user-posted question to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">r/AskReddit</a>, asking &#8220;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/lfiaxz/irl_friends_of_social_media_influencers_what_is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">IRL friends of social media &#8216;influencers&#8217;: what is it like?</a>&#8220;. Now Reddit gives you the chance to anonymously post anything, so friends who could not directly criticize their friends got an opportunity to say what they actually feel. Take a look at some of the answers received on the AskReddit question.</p>

She’s a genuine person but also lies, if that makes sense? She very much about empower women and helping people accept themselves and build their confidence, which is a great platform! However, some of the anecdotes she tells about “struggling with fitting in” when she was a teen are blatant lies. She was popular and every guy had a crush on her. I don’t want to undermine whatever internal struggle she faced, but when she tells stories about bullying in high school, they’re lies. She’s genuine about wanting to be positive for people, I just wish she did it a bit more honestly.</figcaption></figure>

She screams at them to smile and on one occasion, said I don’t give a fk if you don’t like the fken juice! Just pretend and smile! It’s all fake and I hate it.</figcaption></figure>

My friend is conventionally attractive, and if you look at her social media, you&#8217;d think she were a supermodel millionaire who goes on tons of trips. She&#8217;s actually chronically unemployed, and has an income of less than 10k/yr. Her boyfriend makes about $60k/yr which is enough to afford them a very nice 3 1/2 bedroom apartment, and she has tons of props she uses to make each room look different from day to day so it seems like she&#8217;s always in a new, exotic place. They take two trips a year to fun, tropical places, in which she takes many photos, and posts them as different places throughout the year. She&#8217;s a very kind, considerate, sparkling personality, but whenever we hang out, I tend to be a shoulder to cry on as she laments about her lack of success in life. It&#8217;s quite sad, honestly. But with her creativity and personality, I think she&#8217;ll achieve her dreams eventually.</figcaption></figure>

He invited us to his house for a Christmas party and this is when I realized how fake social media was. The guy didn’t have the car he paraded on social media. He he leased it, took several photo shoots with it, then gave it back. His house was in a different city than he claimed. I don’t think it was for security reasons though. He said he lived in a very rich city but his house was in a more modest place. He asked me to send him the videos I took at the party, posted them, and didn’t even tag me because I “didn’t have enough followers”? The worst part was that all the social media people at the party just kept yelling over each other trying to make the next big joke, but none of them were funny. Dude has millions of people fooled.</figcaption></figure>

She was so anxious and stressed all the time. Horribly insecure. If she got some backlash or bad comments she’d be so upset. Was on a lot of anti-anxiety medication. Meanwhile all the posts are her looking beautiful and travelling etc. She didn’t have many friends either (that i saw anyway. Just lots of fans). It looked horrible. Ruined the illusion for me (that their lifestyles are perfect/happy) and i’m thankful for being able to see behind the curtain.</figcaption></figure>

The attitude the mannerisms, everything. It sounds stupid until you realize they clear close to 7 figures a year.

One of my buddies is constantly filming everything we do and posting it. It&#8217;s to the point where people walk up to me on the street and ask me about him because they&#8217;ve seen me in his posts&#8230;i have no idea who they are. It dominates everything he does, and has severely impacted his personal relationships. He can&#8217;t keep a GF and it&#8217;s clearly related to this obsession of his. He does occasionally get some cool stuff out of it though. After pretty much kicking him out of my life because I do not want to be continually posted online, we&#8217;ve come to the understanding that when he&#8217;s about to take a pic or video, he hands me the phone so i&#8217;m not in the shot. Works OK for me.</figcaption></figure>

She still reaches out to me multiple times a year and claims I’m one of her best friends, but it sure doesn’t feel like it. I’ve told her as much, but she just says “this is my life now, my business comes first and if you can’t accept that, then I guess you’re not a real friend.”</figcaption></figure>

I actually emded up cutting her off because everything had to be a photo opportunity. We could never just go out to lunch, or see a movie without it turning into a photoshoot. She never did anything with our friend group unless it was &#8216;aesthetic&#8217;, and even then, she was so focussed on getting us to take photos that a. she didn&#8217;t get to enjoy the activity, and b. it started bringing everyone else down because they couldn&#8217;t participate either. And this sounds so petty, but she could never just show up in a t-shirt and leggings (because photos, obviously). Like even sleepovers and movie nights had to be a big production and sometimes you just need to stuff your face with popcorn and look like a slob! It&#8217;s good for the soul!! She&#8217;d also complain a lot about how hard her job was&#8230; Our friendship group at the time consisted of an EMT, two nurses, a teacher, and me who was juggling university, tutoring, and working retail. Lile, I&#8217;m sure she had challenges and all jobs are hard sometimes, but&#8230; girl&#8230;. you get paid to take selfies with free stuff, and show up at events looking pretty&#8230;</figcaption></figure>

One of my best friends fell real hard into Instagram, and for a few years it was tolerable and understandable, albeit annoying and strange. Everything needed to be documented in specific ways, so lots &amp; lots of photos, even if it took away from the moment. But the strange part was how, when she’d share things, the captions always told a slightly different story than what actually happened. Like just off enough for me and my other friends to say, huh, that has a weird quality to it. Fast forward a couple years, and she gets engaged. Boom. This was the catalyst for the worst of the influencer mentality to come out. I was in the bridal party, and it was a nightmare. No gratitude, just demands. Demands for expensive trips and expensive parties and all kinds of things that were above and beyond the means of her closest friends. And all the demands were because she had a “following” and had certain expectations to meet. It was really heart wrenching to witness someone belittle their best friend and maid of honor for trying to plan a sweet bridal shower because it wasn’t going to be at an expensive restaurant or art gallery. It reached its peak for me when, after the in-state wedding became an expensive destination wedding, there was the demand for an out-of-town bachelorette party a few weeks before. I was honest and said I couldn’t afford the bachelorette (mind you, I made about a thousand sacrifices over those months to afford what I could), and was promptly bridezilla’d and told I ruined the whole experience and that I was an awful, fake, inauthentic person. It got so bad that the bridal party fractured and disintegrated, she lost two of her best friends (myself and the MOH didn’t even attend the wedding after all her behavior and blow-ups), and we’ve barely spoken since. All so she could have an instagrammable wedding that would look good for the few photos she ended up sharing of it. And, true to the weird strange re-written reality ways she had, she published a public “apology” on her blog for her followers and family that completely distorted and rewrote what happened, painted herself as the victim, and got her the sympathy points she was looking for. Ppl really lose themselves when they create an artifice for social media. I learned a lot from her.</figcaption></figure>

Asking me to go to nice places (they didn&#8217;t drive) only to leave me on a bench somewhere while they took pictures.

She dropped out of school and endorsing products and taking pictures of herself is the only way she knows how to pay rent. Irl she&#8217;s basically the complete opposite of the happy bubblly ditzy girl she plays online and we often laugh over some of the messages she receives, including proposals and women angry that their sons/husbands are following her.</figcaption></figure>

Now I just sort of want to blow my brains out when I’m around her. She’s just so obsessed and fake now. It actually makes me really sad.</figcaption></figure>

In the beginning they started because they got offers from brands because they were so popular on Instagram and it was a lot of fun for them. Now they don’t ever post pictures or videos without a filter. Rarely ever like a picture on the first try and don’t you dare post any pictures of them without getting their approval for it. Imagine trying to get a group picture with all of your friends for your birthday but having you take almost one hundred shots to get one that your influencer friend is happy with. Also in the beginning I would like and comment on all of their posts but now that’s not enough. They expect me message it others, share it on my stories and my page (something about new rhythms and likes not being important anymore). I hate posting stuff to my page but I do it any way to be supportive. It is so tiring. They do get free things sometimes though that they sometimes share with me. Not worth it imo.</figcaption></figure>
