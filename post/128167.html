			<p>Freddie Mercury, the ultimate cat lover did something special for his cats. Usually, a cat lover would buy a present such as a nice collar with a tag for the pet. But this rockstar dedicated songs to his loving cats. It is said that Freddie developed a love for cats when his girlfriend Mary brought him two cats in &#8217;70s. When he used to attend music tours, he used to call Mary to check on the cats as she stayed with them.</p>

<p>“He’d come to the hotel, call and really talk to his cats,” Freestone said. “Mary would hold Tom and Jerry in turns to get them to the phone so they could hear Freddie talking. This continued over the years, with the next cats that came to her house,” he wrote in his memoir.</p>

<p>“Innuendo, the last album he recorded with the band, included images of Mercury disguised as a jester with cats on his shoulders. And a lively track called Delilah. At first you might think it was about a woman, until you get to the verse where “he pees on his Chippendale furniture.” And he has a Brian May solo that sounds like a meow. May also had quite a few cats over the years. These days, he has to travel so much he can’t have one, but according to Smith, “he’s still a cat lover, no dogs.”</p>

<p>“Freddie treated the cats like his own children. He worried about them constantly, and if anything happened to one while he was away, God help us. During the day, the cats would run around the house and the surrounding grounds, and at night one of us would look for them and bring them in,” he explained in his memoirs.</p>
