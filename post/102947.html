			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dog smell is not a big issue but some people are really sensitive to it. Even if they are not, they just don’t like dogs&#8217; smell. And if you are living with any such people you might know how hard things can get when you really wanna have a furry friend but you can’t. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, there is a silver lining. If the smell is the problem, we got a solution. If you want a dog, why don’t you get one that doesn&#8217;t stink?

Also, Havanese does not smell so you can one without thinking twice.</span></p>
<h2>2. Kerry Blue Terrier</h2>

<h2>10. Schnauzers</h2>
