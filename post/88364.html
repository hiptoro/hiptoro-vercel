			<p>Here is the beautiful and loving story between a woman and a dog who both were afraid of each other but became friends after many hardships. A woman, Teresa Hwang made a decision to share her emotional story on Tik Tok with her partner, about the dog Boo.</p>
<p>The 55-year-old mathematics teacher was bitten twice by street dogs. And she had a great fear of dogs before she met Boo at a poor shelter place. Boo, too had a fear of people due to his bad experiences with him.</p>
<p>And we think it is nothing but a sheer coincidence, how their paths merged into one. It was not easy for both of them to live together. Teresa made a small start to remove her fear by adopting Boo. They surrounded themselves with patience and unconditional love to develop trust.</p>
<p>Many times I thought if I had any other pet, would I love him the same as I love my little Boo or not? Now he is like my son and I can say it proudly to anyone. I don&#8217;t love him because he loves me and needs me but I love him for who exactly he is, for everything he has overcome and for the joy he has brought into my life,” said Teresa Hwang.</p>
<p>Hwang’s boyfriend wished to have a dog for several years, but the serious decision of adopting one came up a couple of years ago. After he took care of her sister’s dog, Rocky, for a week.</p>
<p>After visiting numerous rescue shelters, they found a dog named Patches (later called Boo) at Niagara Dog Rescue. Boo had been in the system for about 6 months, originally from Texas.</p>

<p>People told them that Boo doesn&#8217;t feel good in noise, crowded areas, or with children, but he felt good with other dogs. They named him as “prince of dogs”.</p>
<p>Boo slowly came out of his shelter and moved towards Teresa. “When I turned to see, he licked my nose and then quickly withdrew and hid behind his shelter,” she said.</p>
<p>Everyone was astonished. They said, “It is amazing. He doesn’t go near people. Maybe he chose you.”</p>

<p>At that very moment, all my fear and concerns vanished forever. She made a decision to take him home. The starting days with him were complex. He did not enjoy food, walk, enjoyment, games, etc.</p>

<p>But as time flew, they lived a happy life together. Boo and Teresa learned a lot from each other. She’s not afraid of her little dog, but she still goes nervous around others.</p>
<p>They both helped each other to heal &amp; grow together which truly transformed them. Caring for Boo has taught Teresa to remain patient and give unconditional love. The duo proves that <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/30-dogs-mom-that-are-tired-of-their-puppies-it-shows-on-their-face/">dogs</a> and humans can be the best friends for sure.</p>
