			<p>I&#8217;ve heard my fair share of clichéd discourse as a woman, particularly in relation to the female body. How many times do you recall hearing a boy or even a man make an absurd comment about menstruation? Oh my god, that was funny.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I was interested when I recently came across a Reddit thread asking, &#8220;Women of Reddit, What&#8217;s your &#8216;That&#8217;s not how women work&#8217; moment?&#8221; I simply had to tell my female friends about it. Check out the amusing answers below and laugh out loud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A quick solution.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208997" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1557aae0-d833-49b8-ad09-20e333126976.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1440" /></p>
<p class="mt-3.5 xl:mt-6 font-montserrat font-medium text-base leading-6 text-gray-600">&#8220;The first guy I dated wanted to go swimming, but I told him no because I started my period and felt sore and crampy. He asked me if I could finish it before the end of the day so we could go swimming the next day…bruh, I wish it was that easy!&#8221;</p>
<p class="mt-3.5 xl:mt-6 font-montserrat font-medium text-base leading-6 text-gray-600">I know, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>An innocent confusion.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208996" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2c2ebbf1-feb5-4a29-a739-246be5e0e059.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1440" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Had a very amusing convo with a gentleman once. Dude was confused about why we would need pads. He asked why we didn&#8217;t just go to the toilet more often on our periods. He thought that we were able to hold our period in line as you do with pee and pads are only if accidents happen. So his reasoning is that if women would be more careful we wouldn&#8217;t need menstrual products. Props to him, he was apologetic after I explained it to him and overall respectful.&#8221;</p>
<p>A poor uninformed guy indeed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A Biology class fail.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208995" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/f5800281-bf85-4a49-a953-d021a46ccd4b.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1440" /></p>
<p>&#8220;My ex-husband asked me why I hadn&#8217;t had my period in a while&#8230; I was eight months pregnant.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious as to why he was an ex-husband. Am I correct? Okay, I know that wasn&#8217;t the cause, but it&#8217;s still funny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Misinformation.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208994" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1bc8ac98-ded3-4542-a9ca-77956fcd81b5.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1618" /></p>
<p>&#8220;When my ex and I discussed how the morning-after pill worked and he was genuinely surprised that women don&#8217;t know whether they are pregnant the day after unprotected sex. He was sure morning sickness would kick in the day after.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oh, if only it were that simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Reality check.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-208993" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/41649cc1-1d93-4d98-b6a1-dc874464eff8.gif" alt="" width="776" height="427" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Person on TV gives birth. Five minutes later, belly is flat and back to normal. THAT&#8217;S NOT HOW THAT WORKS.&#8221;</p>
<p>How often have you had to correct some ignorant guy&#8217;s misconceptions, ugh? Women have amazing bodies, and it&#8217;s amazing how quickly they can get back in shape.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>An uninformed comment.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208992" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/67fc4f01-5fa3-444b-9ed2-2b745be3cb88.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1446" /></p>
<p>&#8220;My (male) manager at a past job tried to tell me when I was pregnant that morning sickness shouldn&#8217;t affect my work because it only happened in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tell that to any woman who has endured day-in and day-out morning sickness for several weeks. I dare you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>An apparent trick.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208991" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/0c7515bb-dd1d-44bb-8bc9-a90e7841fb00.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1727" /></p>
<p>&#8220;An old boyfriend once explained that if I was having cramps, I just needed to do what his ex did: &#8216;There&#8217;s this one yoga pose that will make that shift in the uterus that usually takes a few days to happen in just a few minutes. It drops, and then your period is done in one day instead of four or five.&#8217; He couldn&#8217;t elaborate any further, (what &#8216;shifts&#8217;? What &#8216;drops&#8217;?) But he swore he was 100% right his ex cut her period down to one day with yoga.&#8221;</p>
<p>How come I haven&#8217;t heard of this wizardry here, um, okay?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A misinformed mother.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-208990" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/e6f328e2-1df1-422e-b4e6-c045287a779c.gif" alt="" width="596" height="624" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I heard this with my own two poor ears from my own mother: &#8216;When a woman shaves her leg, hair shouldn&#8217;t start growing until the next 4 or 5 days. Only men grow hair every day.&#8217; MOOOM!&#8221;</p>
<p>If only. Ha!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A period advice.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208989" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/2b39bb45-e871-4892-9b27-47ea9dfce324.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1620" /></p>
<p>&#8220;My boyfriend told me to shower in cold water so my period would temporarily stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Okay, and once more, how does that operate? What connection is there between your period and taking a cold shower? Hee-hee, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Stereotypical thinking.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208988" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/806e8ac6-ef9c-4387-9938-57e689ce6285.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1440" /></p>
<p>&#8220;When a guy commented on a post asking what women think and said women only care about looks. Like sure, some people of either gender are like that. But I surely don’t care if he’s a 10/10 if he can’t hold a conversation.&#8221;</p>
<p>True that!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>An ignorant comment.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208987" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/835cd45b-875e-4c72-bd23-08f1b8a1c18b.gif" alt="" width="500" height="499" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I was complaining about my period, and this awful guy goes &#8216;Just [pee] it out.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Why on earth do males think we can delay our period like we delay urination, and then it&#8217;s gone, huh? It&#8217;s really hard to believe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>An insane suggestion.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208986" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/9de4b3c7-e02d-4686-a708-3b6adf817402.jpg" alt="" width="2137" height="1603" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I have a friend who works for the state government. She can confirm that some high-ranking dude in our state government thinks that women should just hold in their periods and let it out during their bathroom breaks.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sincerely want that this guy could go through a day of having a period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A T.V. scenario.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-208985" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/5b87eb42-83e3-4df5-94ae-8f9be9867961.gif" alt="" width="795" height="447" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Had a guy friend in college who seriously thought women leaked blue liquid during their periods, like what you see in maxi pad commercials.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m laughing so hard at that, haha.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What a funny comment.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208984" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/e820190a-4af0-463e-aec7-e648c98dcb5a.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1440" /></p>
<p>&#8220;My (female) BFF (male) was my date to the prom. Because of my awful luck, I happened to be on my period. As we exited my car, I grabbed a handful of tampons to toss in my clutch and my date asked me &#8216;Omg are you having eight periods??&#8217; Yeah, he thought you used 1 tampon per menstrual cycle. If only — the $ I would have saved over the years!&#8221;</p>
<p>Ha, ha, we could have all saved so much money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The confusion about breast milk.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-208983" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/aa79915f-3295-49f1-9879-7336d8c6869d.gif" alt="" width="555" height="555" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The best situation I can think of was something a friend of mine said once. His sister was breastfeeding and said something like &#8216;I don’t know if I have enough left&#8217; to her baby. So my friend kindly suggested that someone else can volunteer and asked me. I said well I’m not lactating, since I don’t have a baby and he was honestly shocked to learn that only women who actually gave birth are able to breastfeed. He was convinced every woman just casually has boobs full of breastmilk at all times. He was 25 at that time. I will never forget this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unbelievable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A period lesson.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208982" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/f8d51c8f-4742-4a56-b704-293b421c5054.jpeg" alt="" width="716" height="471" /></p>
<p class="mt-3.5 xl:mt-6 font-montserrat font-medium text-base leading-6 text-gray-600">&#8220;I was on my period and I had horrible cramps. One of my guy friends came over to keep me company but he wasn&#8217;t really prepared for how much pain I was in. I was crying because it hurt so bad and the poor guy really wanted to help but didn&#8217;t know what to do so he just suggested that I &#8216;push out all the blood at once bc that usually helped him when trying to stop a nosebleed.</p>
<p class="mt-3.5 xl:mt-6 font-montserrat font-medium text-base leading-6 text-gray-600">After he said that I looked at him like &#8216;wtf&#8217; and he said &#8216;What? Doesn&#8217;t it stop hurting once all the blood is out?&#8217; I explained to him what happens to a female body when we get our period and he was just shocked, it kinda cheered me up tho because I thought it was hilarious.&#8221;</p>
<p>OMG!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>I&#8217;m speechless.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-208981" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/1383409c-320d-4cf3-8576-8a8abe148bed.gif" alt="" width="772" height="434" /></p>
<p>Can you believe there are so many myths and falsehoods regarding women&#8217;s bodies? Where does it originate from, exactly? Some of these had me laughing aloud while others had me shaking my head in utter bewilderment. We may be able to educate a lot more people if we start discussing women&#8217;s bodies openly. How do you feel?</p>
