<h3>Meet Lilo the husky. She’s a pooch from San Jose, California who goes on adventures with her owners and furry family members.</h3>
<p>In Lilo’s “pack” is one creature that may look slightly different than the rest – but don’t let that fool you. They’re really best-buds! They vehemently proved the fact wrong that cats and dogs can&#8217;t be friends.</p>

<h2>Rosie’s a cat keeping up with her canine siblings.</h2>
<p>While you might not think of a cat as being part of a group of huskies, Rosie fits right in with hers. Together, they live exciting lives full of outdoor activities and road trips – enjoying everything from lakes, to mountains, to kayaks. Really, how many cats can you say do that?</p>

<h2>She was a tiny kitten when they rescued her off the streets.</h2>
<p>Rosie was only two-weeks-old when the Bui sisters first brought her into their home. Sadly though, she wasn’t healthy in the beginning. At one point it even seemed like she might “not make it.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“By some miracle, she started suckling on Lilo and Lilo went full “mom mode”. Even stimulating it to go to the bathroom..😦 (This was very shocking to me). Since then, Rosie’s been getting much better and her eyes opened!”</p></blockquote>
<p>On the second night, they captured the most adorable footage of Lilo and her new best friend Rosie.</p>
