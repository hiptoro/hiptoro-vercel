			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we watch movies, there are some creepy characters that are hard to recognize. But do you know why these characters are unrecognizable? It&#8217;s because of heavy makeup, SFX, and masks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tell the audience how actors nail these famous creepy characters, the owner of Fxattics Studios, Angela Norris from Brooklyn decided to share some insights with us. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help us understand in a better way, Angela has placed actors next to the creepy characters that they have played. </span></p>

<p>&#8220;I am a huge John Carroll Lynch fan and he portrays Twisty the clown of American Horror Story. So many people did not know that that was him. So, I decided to make a bunch of art pieces of horror Icons and the actors who portray them. A behind the mask and makeup, if you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was born in Salem, Massachusetts, so you could say horror is in my blood. I have been in love with horror and monsters since I was 4 years old, at which time I accidentally watched A Nightmare on Elm Street with my brother Ken. My husband Alan and I run Fxattics Studios. I run the artistic side and he runs the business and marketing. I got the better end of the deal, if I do say so myself.</p>
<p>We have two children, Abigail, who is 10, and Adam, who is 14. They are often used as models and in our promotional videos. The apple didn&#8217;t fall far, that&#8217;s for sure. All the magic happens in Brooklyn, Michigan, which is where Fxattics Studios is located.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to make monsters. Rick Baker, Tom Savini, and Ve Neil were my superheroes. The transformation scene in An American Werewolf in London—a thing of beauty. I was hooked. Sculpting and creating is a dream. I have sold masks to almost every continent. Hundreds worldwide. Each one handmade by us. Seeing the joy our masks have brought to people makes everything we do worth it. There&#8217;s something about being the bump in the night on Halloween that fuels us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I love about horror is that it creates feelings much like being in love. The feeling of being scared and not knowing what&#8217;s coming next is so stimulating. Obviously, on the fictional level. I fell in love with my husband while watching horror movies. He had not seen many when we met. Still brings us together now.  We scare each other all the time. Even the kids will hide for minutes on end for the perfect scare.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we teach and preach that real monsters do not wear masks. We love what we do and know that the horror genre isn&#8217;t for everyone. For those like us who love it, we try to create content that stimulates, gets that blood pumping.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about. My mom and dad told me I could be anything I wanted when I grew up, even when I told them I wanted to make scary monsters and masks. I am proof that you can make dreams come true if you are willing to do the hard work to get there. We scare because we care.&#8221;</p>
