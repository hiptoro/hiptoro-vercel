			<p>&#8220;Black Adam&#8221; is the first movie in the DC Extended Universe to feature Dwayne Johnson as the title character, an antihero who isn&#8217;t as nice as other costumed crusaders.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s safe to say that Black Adam&#8217;s methods scare everyone else, which is why Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) sends Superman (Henry Cavill) to face him at the end of the movie.</p>
<p>The scene is definitely a crowd-pleaser because it confirms that Henry Cavill is back as the Man of Steel after a long time away from the role and lots of rumors about the actor possibly leaving the cape and tights.</p>
<p>Even though it&#8217;s great for fans that Cavill is finally back, Johnson recently said on Twitter that the studio &#8220;inexplicably and inexcusably&#8221; didn&#8217;t want him back.</p>
<p>In a video celebrating the success of the 2022 movie on iTunes, the &#8220;Black Adam&#8221; star talked about bringing back Superman. He said that his team worked for a long time to bring back Henry Cavill as Superman.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This has been years in the making regarding bringing Henry Cavill back and years of strategic conversations and we were not going to take no for an answer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Johnson went on to say that the DCEU couldn&#8217;t move forward without Cavill&#8217;s hero being involved in some way.</p>
<p>The actor added:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was no way, there&#8217;s no viable logical way that you can attempt to build out the DC Universe without the most powerful force and the greatest superhero of all time sitting on the sidelines. It&#8217;s impossible to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though several actors have played the Kryptonian hero in live-action movies over the years, Johnson praised Cavill&#8217;s performance and said that fans have been wondering where he has been for the past few years.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sayin‚Äô thank ya so much from my ol‚Äô pick up truck for all the amazing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackAdam?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackAdam</a> support and reactions <br />#1 movie on iTunes üî• <br />We‚Äôll remain in theaters as well throughout the holidays üéÖüèæ‚ö°Ô∏è<br />Also wanted to give ya some <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Superman?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Superman</a> info üëäüèæ<br />Happy ü¶Éüçø <a href="https://t.co/WyGa49J7Dr">pic.twitter.com/WyGa49J7Dr</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Dwayne Johnson (@TheRock) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRock/status/1595517243831377921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 23, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>He explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>It all comes back to: &#8216;Where&#8217;s Superman?&#8217; You have to have Superman in the mix. So that&#8217;s why we fought hard to bring Superman back, Henry Cavill. And there was no other Superman, by the way, to bring back.</p></blockquote>
<p>Johnson also praised the British actor, calling him &#8220;the greatest Superman of all time.&#8221; He then said that Warner Bros. can &#8220;now build out the DC Universe properly, strategically, and smartly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The actor from &#8220;Jumanji&#8221; and &#8220;Red Notice&#8221; also hinted that the DCEU is about to change now that James Gunn and Peter Safran are in charge of the future of the franchise.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Again, the hierarchy of power in the DC Universe has changed and, of course, now we have new leadership at DC and at Warner Bros.</p></blockquote>
