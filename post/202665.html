			<p>A normal day turned into one they will never forget for a group of fishermen.</p>
<p>Their journey began when they found a sperm whale that was stuck on the beach. They called their local fishery office for help freeing the whale because they knew they had to do something. The rescue began at 8 A.M. It took 20 hours to complete.</p>
<p>Rescue crews threw buckets of water on the whale to keep him alive since he was at risk of dying of dehydration. Several ships drag the whale back into the ocean as the tide gets to its highest level. Yay! Talk about some great teamwork!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to share this amazing rescue mission.</p>
