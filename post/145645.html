<h2>Nefertiti</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-145647 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-70.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="572" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-70.jpg 880w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-70-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-70-768x499.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-70-540x350.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;This bust of Nefertiti (believed to have been sculpted during her lifetime) is famous for its grace and beauty. Nefertiti lived from approximately 1370 &#8211; 1330 BC. She was an Egyptian queen and the wife of Akhenaten, an Egyptian Pharaoh. Akhenaten is famous for his attempt to transition Egypt into a monotheistic society (worshipping only the sun god, Aten), instead of a polytheistic one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did some research on his looks and it is recorded that he had curly golden hair and heterochromia (one eye blue and one eye brown or a combo of both), so he was definitely a striking figure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Agrippina the Younger is someone I only recently learned more about but she had a crazy life. She was the sister of Emperor Caligula and the mother of Emperor Nero. I highly recommend giving her a search if you’re interested in that era of Roman history!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jeanne Antoinette Poisson, better known as Madame de Pompadour. She first caught the eye of Louis XV at a masked ball in 1745 (it was said that she was dressed as a domino, and he was dressed as a plant) and was his chief mistress thereafter until 1751. Even after she was no longer Louis&#8217; mistress, she was a trusted friend, confidante, and advisor, essentially becoming one of the most powerful women at the French court until her death in 1764.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Empress Elisabeth Of Austria <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-145660 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10-58.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="557" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10-58.jpg 880w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10-58-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10-58-768x486.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></h2>
<p>&#8220;During her life, Elisabeth (known as Sisi), was known for being beautiful, smart, rebellious and passionate. Definitely worth some digging into if you are interested in late 1800s Europe.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Louis XIV, The Sun King <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-145662 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/11-55.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="612" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/11-55.jpg 880w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/11-55-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/11-55-768x534.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></h2>
<h2>Katherine Of Aragon <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-145664 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12-54.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="494" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12-54.jpg 880w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12-54-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12-54-768x431.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12-54-438x246.jpg 438w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12-54-255x144.jpg 255w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></h2>
<p>&#8220;This portrait of Katherine of Aragon, wife of King Henry VIII and Queen of England from 1509-1533, has always been my favorite. There are several portraits of her that all range in looks, so it’s hard to tell her true likeness. I think this one captures her piety, meekness, and obedience as documented by historians.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Louis XV <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-145666 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/13-50.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="558" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/13-50.jpg 880w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/13-50-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/13-50-768x487.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></h2>
<p>&#8220;Louis XV is lesser known than his predecessor the Sun King and his heir, Louis XVI, but he was the second-longest reigning monarch in French history. I have always known him by his famous mistresses, Madame De Pompadour and Madame du Barry.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Catherine Parr <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-145668 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14-50.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="624" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14-50.jpg 880w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14-50-300x213.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/14-50-768x545.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></h2>
<p>&#8220;She was the only wife to outlive the king, who was tyrannical in his last years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Queen Isabella of Castile, partner to Ferdinand II of Aragon and the queen who sent Columbus on his way to the “new world” in 1492. &#8221;</p>
<h2>Emperor Augustus <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-145676 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18-43.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="539" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18-43.jpg 880w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18-43-300x184.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/18-43-768x470.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></h2>
<p>&#8220;Emperor Augustus (born Octavius, the great-nephew of Julius Caesar) was the first emperor of Rome, ending 500 years of the republic. He’s an incredibly controversial figure, especially due to the smart and ruthless way he came to power, but he ruled over a time of relative peace in the Roman empire.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Abraham Lincoln <img decoding="async" class="wp-image-145678 size-full aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/19-43.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="558" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/19-43.jpg 880w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/19-43-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/19-43-768x487.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></h2>
<p>&#8220;Abe Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865. Lincoln led the nation through the American Civil War, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis. He preserved the Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the U.S. economy.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Christina Of Denmark <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-145679 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20-40.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="460" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20-40.jpg 880w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20-40-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/20-40-768x401.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></h2>
<p>&#8220;Christina of Denmark, seen here in an original Hans Holbein portrait, lived from 1521 &#8211; 1590. Christina was considered as a possible bride for King Henry VIII of England. Christina was not fond of the English King&#8217;s reputation, given that he had divorced his first wife and beheaded his second wife. The originator of one of the greatest quotes about King Henry in history, Christina famously said: &#8220;If I had two heads, one should be at the King of England&#8217;s disposal.&#8221; What an amazing denial to a marriage proposal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Katherine Howard (c. 1523 – 13 February 1542) was Queen of England for only 16 months as the fifth wife of Henry VIII. Katherine was actually the cousin of Henry&#8217;s second wife, Anne Boleyn. When they married, he was 49 and she only 16 or 17. Katherine was accused of adultery and executed by the King, ending her short reign as the Queen of England.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Eleanor Of Toledo <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-145683 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/22-33.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="557" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/22-33.jpg 880w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/22-33-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/22-33-768x486.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></h2>
