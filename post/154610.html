If you want someone you don&#8217;t know well to like you, ask them for a small favor.</p>
<p>When I get new coworkers I go out of my way to ask them for something little, like borrowing a stapler or giving an opinion on something I&#8217;m working on.</p>
<p>Then they feel like they can ask me for something next time they need help, and soon I&#8217;ve tricked them into thinking I&#8217;m a nice person.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why it works but it does.</p>

I&#8217;ve worked in mental health for years. I can&#8217;t tell you how many people tell me what a good listener I am..because I just shut up and let people talk.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not rocket science, but the large majority of people just want to feel like their voices are being heard. Too many therapists and providers don&#8217;t know how to be quiet and stop loving the sound of their own voices.</p>

<p>I live in a dry climate and static cling was always a problem. I really dislike fabric softeners for multiple reasons, but this trick solved the problem.</p>
<p>Take an old cloth (mine is a cloth napkin) and pin 7-10 big safety pins to it. Just toss it in the dryer with your clothes. The safety pins hit the sides of the dryer, continually grounding your laundry.</span></p>

Taking a shower to remedy any ailment. Prescribed by my mother. Headache? Take a shower. Anxious? Go take a shower with lavender. Have a cold? Get in the shower with a Vix vapor rub. It&#8217;s not a cure-all, but I guarantee it always makes me feel less bad than before.</p>

My depression makes it hard for me to do chores on command, but I figured out that if I set a timer or give myself some time to psych myself up, then I do it.
