He proposed at a surprise party in front of all their friends (including me) and families. She said &#8220;Here and now, no&#8221;. Then she dragged him out of there by the collar to an empty room, told him EXACTLY how he&#8217;d messed up, stating &#8220;I&#8217;ve never doubted that I wanted to be with you forever until you pulled that&#8221;. He apologized. Then got down on one knee and gave her the quiet, private proposal she wanted, to which she said &#8220;like this, hell yes&#8221;. Then they return to the party to celebrate and announce that they were engaged. It was one of the most awkward 15 minutes of my life but I have never respected her more!</figcaption></figure>

Got out of Boot, went to Tech School in Texas. Was able to come home, which was in Rhode Island, every couple of months or so. I asked her to marry me. She said no, we were too young, and I was only asking since I was away and lonely. I persisted, but she was resolute. Got out of Boot, and was at my first Duty Station, a year after I had gone in. I asked her again. She said no, still too young to know what we were doing. Got in a fight, kinda had a &#8220;break&#8221; in the relationship for a while. Got back together, and I decided not to ask again, as she was obviously not going to marry me. Six months later, she said to me, &#8220;So, did you give up on marrying me?&#8221; I said &#8220;Pretty much, yeah&#8221; Her: Well, my answer might be different now. Me: Can&#8217;t risk it, my fear of rejection is insisting I never ask again. Her: No, really, I might have changed my mind. Me: Sorry, twice bitten, yada yada. She basically had to guarantee me should would say yes before I would ask her again. Today, I woke up, rolled over to give her a kiss, and realized this is our 41st Christmas together, so I got that going for me, which is nice.<span style="font-size: 16px">  </span></figcaption></figure>

One guy made the proposal, the other one rejected him because he wanted to propose, had the same plan, goes on his knees, and proposed to him. After that, they were arguing about who is allowed to propose, both were prepared and both bought rings.</figcaption></figure>

Then I asked if she wanted to marry me so I could be king, but she was already married.</figcaption></figure>

She got all flustered and scared, because her family was all homophobic conservatives and she never did end up telling them that she was dating a girl (I have a pretty masculine name) and she was worried about me because she didn’t want me to get insulted or hurt by her family. It ended with her trying to think up the best hypothetical ways to tell her family that she was “marrying a girl” with the most minimally worst result because she didn’t want to reject me since she really did love the idea of us being married, and me telling her that if she wasn’t ready to marry because of whatever reason then she can say “no.” Which ended with us not being engaged that day. The funny thing was that she was normally the more relaxed out of the two of us, and seeing her freaking out and being all nervous like that was both endearing and concerning because I never expected her to act like that. Sadly, we did end up breaking up and she’s now currently married to a man (we’re both bi, LOL) that she’s more than happy with; and whom I like as well because he really does treat her well and she does deserve the absolute BEST. But damn, sometimes I really do miss those times. She was one of the best partners I’ve ever had; but if she’s happy with her life, I am too.</figcaption></figure>

Guy just won an amateur bodybuilding contest and his partner came up on stage with him. He immediately drops to one knee and asks for her to marry him. She doesn’t say a word and starts to shake her head no and he starts to weep on stage while still holding the microphone. Nothing like watching a grown man oiled up in a banana hammock ugly crying in front of an arena full of people.</figcaption></figure>

We were at the part of the catch-up where we were talking about relationships etc. I told him about my long-term boyfriend (8 years) and our house and dogs. But he just couldn&#8217;t fathom that Nathan and I weren&#8217;t married and that I didn&#8217;t care that we weren&#8217;t. No matter what we talked about next, he&#8217;d always bring it back to, &#8220;you must be so unhappy he doesn&#8217;t love you enough&#8221; and &#8220;what a shame a nice girl like you is stuck with him.&#8221; Got quite annoyed but sort of forgot about him and the whole thing pretty quickly. Fast forward to a year later, and I was at a friend&#8217;s wedding with my partner. Joe was also there. Nathan had just gone to grab us some drinks and came back to Joe down on one knee proposing to me, with a ring and everything. He was saying how he could make me so much happier and give me the life I&#8217;d always wanted with children and I&#8217;d never had to work again. Which if you know me, is very not me. I was just looking at him with my mouth open, completely taken aback. Nathan just looked from me to him then back to me. I had a deer in the headlights look. I honestly had no idea what to say or do. I scrambled out of my chair and said, &#8220;no thanks Joe. I&#8217;m good.&#8221; Downed my champagne and ran to the dance floor. I&#8217;ve never been happier to dance my whole life, and I really don&#8217;t like dancing in public.</figcaption></figure>

The guy at the table next to me gets down on a knee between our tables (only he barely fit and kept bumping my table). She was horrified he was asking and said no. They hadn’t even eaten yet so they had the rest of their meal while bickering about the proposal. He kept yell asking her what he should do with the ring now. Truly the most awkward meal of my life sitting less than a foot from that.</figcaption></figure>

They even talked about it and she&#8217;d said stuff like &#8220;I&#8217;d be prepared to say yes as soon as you ask.&#8221; Pretty up the middle right? Well, he proposed and she said she wasn&#8217;t ready for the settled life, tried to keep the ring, broke up with him (she needed to find herself apparently?), And when she couldn&#8217;t explain why to her friends and family, made up (and then recanted) an abuse saga to justify her leaving. Turns out she&#8217;d actually been low-key gold digging the whole time and was only dating him because it cut her rent in half and she could drive his truck (couldn&#8217;t afford a car). She ended up with one of the &#8216;nice guy&#8217; types but she&#8217;s basically ripping that dude apart right now (and just crashed his car&#8230;). So bizarre and she seemed pretty normal when she was dating my buddy. Bullet dodged ig</figcaption></figure>

I was still very in love with him at that moment and i thought he had the same feelings. The 3rd night I had a bad fever and told him he could go out if he wanted because I was going to bed at like 7pm. So he went to the hotel bar I think. I woke up at 4:00ish all sweaty and took a shower and he was still not back from drinking, so I went to the hotel bar (this was a big hotel so it was stil open and pretty crowded) and saw my boyfriend being a little to comfortable with some college-age girl. I asked a waitress of she had seen him do anything, and she told me they had been making out dozens of times. I was too shocked/hurt that moment for the confrontation so promised myself to break up with him as soon as we got home. 3 days later, while we were at another hotel, he asked me to marry him. The answer and the reason were pretty obvious.</figcaption></figure>

We’d been together 3 or 4 years at that point, lived together, planned to have the kid. I turned him down and told him it was because I thought he was doing it because of the baby. I wanted it to be because of me and not an obligation and I think I was a little hurt that he hadn’t asked before when it was just me in the equation. I told him If he waited one more year and still wanted to and asked again I would say yes. It took him three more kids and like 5-6 more years to ask again (so now we have been together for almost 11 years and have 4 kids), but we are finally getting married in two days :).</figcaption></figure>
