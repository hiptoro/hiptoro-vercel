			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine that you have got the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">puppy of your dreams. You are very excited because now, you can finally share your life with the dog you like so much. But as the day passes by, you start noticing something unusual. You then conclude that your dorkie chorkie looks kinda different. And then happens the unbelievable, you realize that your dog is everything except the breed you have imagined it to be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don&#8217;t worry because you are not alone. Yes, you have read that right! Just like you, there are many other people who have faced the same thing. From believing they got a wiener dog to raising an English cocker spaniel, expectations hit with a reality check after the dogs grew up. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, these people got bamboozled! But nothing matters because these dogs are so cute. If you also want to see the pictures of these adorable doggos, keep scrolling.</span></p>

<p>He’s a hound mix&#8230; they said. He will be 45 lbs max&#8230; they said. They didn’t say he was mixed with Great Dane. And that he would be 45 lbs when he was 4 months old. Loki is now a comfortable 100lbs.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have talked to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antonio Diaz to know why dogs look becomes a completely different breed once they have grown up. He said that “it happens all the time!” The K9 dog trainer further explained why. First of all “people aren’t doing their research on the breeder.” Secondly, “a low price on a &#8216;purebred dog&#8217; blinds some of us, and you get caught in a scam.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He further said that the majority of such dogs “come from backyard breeders.” He suggests that people should “always ask to see the parents of the puppies AND previous litters.” He also says that if the parents “aren’t’ available, it’s a red flag and you should run.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Antonio said that </span>“they have an undercoat that grows as they get older. Different patterns and colors of fur start to develop and grow in.”  “This is what happened with my own German shepherd. She was dark in her face as a puppy and got lighter as she aged.”</p>
<p>“Young children can have blonde hair and end up being brunet as adults. Our eye colors sometimes change too.”</p>
