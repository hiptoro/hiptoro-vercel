<p>She got a tattoo after discovering she was Māori.</p>
<p>Kaipara was the first woman to have a Mori face tattoo on a news bulletin and she was enjoying it.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>She said, &#8220;I’m not speechless, but it’s a buzz. I am proud of how far I’ve come in being able to anchor 6.00 pm right now. It’s definitely a step forward, and a step-up. If there was a goal for me, it would be anchoring prime-time news, and that’s happened.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kaipara said that she doesn&#8217;t feel the pressure as much as she used to when she first started out in journalism.</p>
<p>‘But that comes with doing the hard yards, and then actually realizing it and doing it is really exciting,’ she added.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kaipara left TVNZ in May to take up a presenting role with Three and hopes to become a permanent host for the bulletin at 6.00 pm.</p>
<p>She said, &#8220;I’ve been realizing for a while that it’s much bigger than just reading the news, or doing stories that matter to all of us. It’s also a big win for this generation and the next 10 generations – don’t let identity or your culture hold you back from anything. In fact, you use it as your power, to be greater and do great things for everyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>‘It’s breaking new ground for us as Māori, but also for people of color. Whether you’ve got a moko kauae or not’, she concluded.</p>
<p>Kaipara will be reading the news on Newshub Live until December 30.</p>
