			<p>Sometimes life encounters good things when you least expect them to happen. The same happened when Bill Shaver left the back door of his car open. Suddenly a stray dog jumped in apparently in search of a place to rest inside the car.</p>
<p>The incident happened last year when Mr. shaver along with his wife were on a trip. They were returning from a fishing trip in the state of Missouri and stopped at a gas station.</p>
<p>Bill was in so hurry that he forgot to close the back door when he rushed to the bathroom at a gas station.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his wife was still sitting in front but the dog didn&#8217;t care and jumped into the back seat.</p>
<p>The dog curled into the blanket kept at the back sheet of the car. Soon the couple noticed and realized that the dog is not in a mood to leave anymore. That very moment they decided to take her to a vet.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-96066" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/stray-dog-gets-in-car-gets-adopted-1.jpg" alt="dog and car" width="728" height="670" /></p>
<p>The vet cleaned her up and quickly examined. The couple got anxious about hearing that the stray dog showed signs of struggle and wounds. She was infected due to the presence of ticks and other insects. Also, she had no other owners or had run away from home.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The couple adopted her and named her River</strong></h2>

<p>Both of them instantly decided to provide her with all the support. They drove her home with them so the dog could recover quickly from illness.</p>
<p>The stray dog never had imagined that this would change her life. She quickly adapted with the couple and began to enjoy their company.</p>
<p>It seems that River was already determined to stay with Shaver&#8217;s family. She has recovered completely and spending her life with new friends and a caring family. I think she deserves this.</p>
