<p>“If I’ve done my math correctly, 91,515 pennies should come out to be about &#8211; at two and a half grams each &#8211; about 504lbs,” Mr. Flaten had told Fox 5 Atlanta.</p>
<p>It was concluded by the department that Mr. Walker didn&#8217;t comply with overtime procedures. That resulted in failing to pay the overtime rate when an employee works over 40 hours a week.</p>
<p>Steven Salazar, the wage and hour division’s district director said: “By law, worker engagement with the U.S. Department of Labour is protected activity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Workers are entitled to receive information about their rights in the workplace and obtain the wages they earned without fear of harassment or intimidation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Flaten&#8217;s girlfriend, Olivia Oxley, wrote a scathing review of the alleged actions.</p>
<p>On Instagram, she wrote: &#8220;First things first, when he quit he gave a written resignation letter complete with a two weeks notice.</p>
<p>&#8220;After Miles Walker of AOK Walker auto works continued to be the a**hole he is and make a normal workday hell, making unnecessary comments about my boyfriend&#8217;s daughter and just be an all-around d**k, that 2 weeks turned into 5 days.</p>
<p>&#8220;My boyfriend respectfully delivered his uniforms washed and in a box complete with another letter as to why he was leaving early.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fast forward 3 months and he was refusing to send out the last paycheck claiming damages to the shop.&#8221;</p>
