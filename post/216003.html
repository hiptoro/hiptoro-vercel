			<p>People in almost every country on Earth like Flamin&#8217; Hot Cheetos. Frito-Lay, a multinational company that makes many different brands of snacks, is given credit for coming up with a great idea for these products. This snack has been around for a long time, and a fan of it has gone to great lengths to make sure it stays an icon. A user on TikTok designed and built an elaborate sarcophagus that can withstand any kind of weather, any kind of climate change, and even the end of the world. What did he want to happen? Flamin&#8217; Hot Cheetos are everyone&#8217;s favorite snack food, so they need to stay good.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216005" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2-1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2-1.jpg 500w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></p>
<p>Nobody, including the &#8220;meme artist&#8221; who made the piece, showed how he did it in a video that was posted to TikTok. When you add up the weight of the body and the huge concrete lid, the huge concrete container weighs a whopping 3,000 pounds. All of the concrete in the box has been coated with protective materials so that it will last longer. Comic Book says that nobody put a bag of Cheetos inside the building and covered it with resin so that it could stand up to earthquakes and other natural disasters.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>He filmed himself the whole time he made the big container, even when he wrote the ingredients on the top of the finished product. After that, he dug a big hole in the ground to bury the container before he was done. He put a plaque at the spot where the body was buried that said, &#8220;Historical artifact buried below. Do not open for 10,000 years. Year buried 2022.&#8221; People were impressed by how hard the man worked to keep his favorite snack for himself.</p>

<p>One user commented, &#8220;They‚Äôll either think we worshipped hot Cheetos or that they destroyed us all. either way, they‚Äôll be correct.&#8221; Another joked, &#8220;I thought I had been bored many times in my life, but now I&#8217;ve realized that I&#8217;ve never been truly, genuinely bored, like Cheetos-sarcophagus bored.&#8221; A third user commented, &#8220;The only heartbreaking thing about this is knowing I‚Äôll never see it get found.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The dedication to this project is astounding,&#8221; said another.</p>

<p>A TikTok user suggested, &#8220;I know this wasn‚Äôt an ad but it‚Äôs been more effective than any ad I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. This is the future of marketing.&#8221; The content creator even replied to one of the comments and mentioned the total cost of this dedicated project. He wrote, &#8220;here&#8217;s my guess on cost: concrete: $400, rebar $100, forms/sled wood: $300, epoxy: $180, rentals: $170, random: $100. total: $1100. hope this helps!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tasting Table says that Flamin&#8217; Hot Cheetos have been a customer favorite since they first came out on the market forty years ago. The company has also made Flamin&#8217; Hot Lim√≥n, XXTRA Flamin&#8217; Hot, and regular Flamin&#8217; Hot versions of this chip in the past. Also, Flamin&#8217; Hot Chipotle Ranch, Flamin&#8217; Hot Pepper Puffs, and Nashville Hot Cheetos were all on the market at one time before they were taken off. Cheetos has decided to bring back some of these flavors that were taken off the market in the past because people wanted them back.</p>
<p>This popular snack isn&#8217;t going away any time soon. In fact, Searchlight Pictures is almost done making a documentary called &#8220;Flamin&#8217; Hot,&#8221; which will come out the year after. The movie will be about Richard Montaez, who came up with the idea for a tasty snack. Even though Montaez&#8217;s part in making the snack has been hotly debated for a long time, the company thinks, &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean we don&#8217;t celebrate Richard, but the facts do not support the urban legend.&#8221;</p>
