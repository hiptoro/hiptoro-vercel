			<p>We have so much on our plate that sometimes how insignificant these things are when we put them against the whole universe. For some people, it may be comforting after knowing that losing a job, abandoning a relationship or a fight with someone is just a fraction of things happening around in the universe. But for others, it may be terrifying as hell.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s so much to see apart from what&#8217;s cooking on our little green planet.</p>
<p>So we have some pictures of the Earth being compared to other significant things in the universe. Once you see them, you&#8217;ll realize that the teensy-weensy problems in your life aren&#8217;t worth breaking a sweat over.</p>
<h2><strong>This is our little planet, the Earth.</strong></h2>

<p>There is so much history to our solar system. If we pay attention, it has a lot of fascinating facts to blow our minds. The solar system is 4.568 billion years old! It consists of a big star, the Sun, 8 planets namely Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and 3 dwarf planets ( Ceres, Pluto, Eris). And it is filled with moons and asteroids in between.</p>
<p>The system mass of the solar system is 1.0014 solar masses (one solar mass is equal to approximately 2×1030 kg, do the calculations) and the majority of the system’s mass is in the Sun (99,86 %) with the remaining majority contained in Jupiter.</p>
<h2><strong>Here’s how far Earth is from the moon – doesn’t seem like that far, right?</strong></h2>

<p>So when we say Jupiter is big, we mean it&#8217;s huge. How huge? Let&#8217;s compare it in numbers. Earth’s radius is 6371.0 km (3958.8 mi) while Jupiter’s radius is 69,911 km (43,441 mi). Its surface area is 6.1419×10<sup>10</sup> km<sup>2</sup> (2.3714×10<sup>10</sup> sq mi) – that means it’s almost 122 times bigger than Earth!</p>
