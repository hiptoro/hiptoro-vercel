<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did you know that scientists have found the first detached coral reef that is discovered in 120 years? We know that’s amazing but what is even more interesting is the fact that this coral reef is bigger than Empire State Building. That’s right! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Empire State Building is 1,454 feet tall. However, this coral reef is 1,600 feet tall. This discovery was made in the ocean that surrounds Australia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To know more, a robot named </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">SuBastian </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">was used to capture high definition images. </span></p>

<p>Dr. Virmani, Executive Director of Schmidt Ocean Institute shared a few things with us. “To find a new half-a-kilometer tall reef in the offshore Cape York area of the well-recognized Great Barrier Reef shows how mysterious the world is just beyond our coastline,” explains Dr. Virmani. “This powerful combination of mapping data and underwater imagery will be used to understand this new reef. And its role within the incredible Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.”</p>
<h2>The first detached coral reef discovered in over 120 years has just been announced by the Schmidt Ocean Institute in Australia.</h2>

<h2>Scientists aboard the Falkor found that the natural structure is about 1,600 feet tall—meaning it soars higher than the Empire State Building, which stands at a height of 1,454 feet.</h2>
