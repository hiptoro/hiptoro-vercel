			<p>Jeff Goldblum became a father later in life, and it sounds like he&#8217;s having a lot of fun with it.</p>
<p>The 70-year-old actor is known for many roles, but he is best known for his work in the Jurassic Park movies in the 1990s and for bringing back his character in the 2022 movie Jurassic World: Dominion.</p>
<p>Jeff married Emilie Livingston, who is 39, in 2014. Together, they have two children. <span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>People</strong></span> said that in 2000, Emilie was a rhythmic gymnast for Canada at the Olympic Games. In 2011, she met her husband at a gym.</p>
<p>In 2015, they had a boy named Charlie Ocean, and in 2017, they had a boy named River Joe. Jeff recently talked to Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager on Today about becoming a father later in life.</p>

<p>When asked how he feels about being a father to two young boys at the age of 70, the actor said that he has &#8220;so much fun&#8221; with them and went on to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s amazing, it’s revivifying, and makes my relationship with Emilie, frankly, enhanced.</p>
<p>Seeing [my wife] in this new role is unbelievable. She’s heroic beyond imagination,</p></blockquote>
<p>he added. Jeff said that being a parent is &#8220;spectacular,&#8221; but he also said that it can be hard.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s challenging and it’s sometimes maddening and very volatile,</p></blockquote>
<p>he said.</p>
<blockquote><p>As you know, at 3 and 5, 5 and 7 they can be like feral creatures unleashed. Oh yeah, and sweet and amazing. It’s great.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jeff told iNews in 2018 that he thinks about how old he is when he thinks about his kids.</p>
<blockquote><p>I keep doing the math and keep extrapolating where they’re going to be, and where I’m going to be. When I buy a watch, I wonder who’s going to get it,</p></blockquote>
<p>he said.</p>
<p>He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m glad I waited. It feels great to do it right now, because all the things I’m considering are perfectly suited to the big questions and challenges of having kids, and what you want to expose them to. What you want to leave them with, what life is, and what kind of life you contribute to them.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are rumors that Jeff will play the Wizard in the upcoming 2024 movie version of the popular musical Wicked.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it sounds like he&#8217;s having a great time being a dad!</p>
