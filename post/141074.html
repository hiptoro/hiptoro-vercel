			<p>Stephanie Medrano is a parent fosterer for Stray Cat Alliance. She was given information about an unusual kitten who was a little unusual. The kitten was born a few hours ago and was very weak. It was unfortunate that the newborn kitten,  was born with a cleft palate and twisted hind legs. The kitten was brought to the vet by his previous owners. They were extremely concerned about his health and what to know what could be done. The vet had to let them know that this poor kitten had very less chances of survival according to his condition.</p>
<p>The previous owner did not know how to look after the kitten well, and so Stephanie came forward to help this precious one.</p>
<h2>Upon taking the kitten, Stephanie noticed another thing about the little guy’s appearance: the kitten had a face reminiscent of an old person. Therefore, she made a quick decision to call him ‘Grandpa’</h2>
