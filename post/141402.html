<p>We have all been dreaming about fairytales in life by seeing Disney Princess movies in our childhood. For all of us who believe that princesses do not have to go through real-life struggle before reaching the happy ending, are partially wrong. Each person has their own struggles. In most cases, princes and princesses have to also go through a lot of drama before they can live together happily ever after. As we tell you about the real love stories of Royal Prince and Princesses, we hope that you learn not to give up on your partner too early. We hope that you believe in love and a happily ever after of your own.</p>
<h2>1. Prince William and Kate Middleton</h2>
</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-141403 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-95.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="551" /></p>
<p>People idolize Prince Willian and Kate, but what they don&#8217;t know that they met first in 2001. Both of them were students at St. Andrews University in Scotland. Though, they did not start dating till 2003.  They did not make it official in the media before marriage but it was known that they were dating. That’s also why their brief breakup in 2007 reverberated in the press.  Later, they both started to attend the same events but tried to maintain a safe distance from each other. It was in 2008 when the couple began to grow closer again with Kate attending some of the Royal family events, even though William was actually not present at all of them. Gradually, the difference between the two disappeared, and the couple got engaged in 2010.</p>
<p>Later in  2011, they got married at Westminster Abbey, and now have three children who make their life complete.</p>

<h2>2. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle</h2>
</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-141404 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-98.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="551" /></p>
<p>Megan and Prince Harry actually met the first time when they were set up for a blind date by a common friend. They till date don&#8217;t know who it was but thank their stars that they could meet each other. Megan has admitted that they were seeing each other for months before they made their first public appearance.  While the actress was shooting for Suits, they often met in Toronto and even in Oxfordshire, at Kensington Palace.</p>
<p>One day, they decided to put the rumours at rest and attended the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Invictus Games</a> in Toronto in 2017 together while holding hands publicly. The same year, the couple announced their engagement in the gardens of Kensington Palace and tied the knot not long after, on May 19, 2018, at St. George’s Chapel. They currently are living in the United States after resigning from exercising their duties as a senior member of the royal family.  They are blessed with a son Archie,</p>

<p>Prince Charles and Lady Diana first met when she was just 16-years-old. If it is true, he was dating her elder sister Sarah back then. Assuming that he must have taken interest in her gradually and asked her to sail or dine with him, the chemistry between the two sparked. In 1980, he finally introduced her to his family at Balmoral, the royal family residence in Scotland.</p>
<p>He finally proposed to her in 1981, and they tied their knot on July 29, 1981 at St. Paul’s Cathedral. The couple welcomed Prince William and Prince Harry into their lives. Later in 1996, their divorce was finalized. And in 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales took her last breath.</p>

<h2>4. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip</h2>
</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-141406 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-92.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="544" /></p>
<p>In 1934, Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip met each other at Prince George’s wedding. She was almost 8 years old and had no clue that this road that laid ahead of her will be for a lifetime. Five years later they met again and started exchanging letter with each other. Philip asked her hand from her father King George, in 1946.  The couple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Princess_Elizabeth_and_Philip_Mountbatten" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">married</a> on November 20, 1947 at Westminster Abbey and Elizabeth was crowned Queen in 1952.

<p>Princess Diana was a big part of their relationship. She knew Sarah for many years and had invited her over to the castle for royal dinners as a guest.
