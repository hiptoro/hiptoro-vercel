			<p>Brittney Griner is in the courtroom now.</p>
<p>The WNBA star is now at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. She was taken there after being released from a Russian prison on December 8. Her agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas, told ESPN that she dunked a basketball for the first time in 10 months. But Brittney isn&#8217;t ready to go back to the sport just yet, even though she did a light workout.</p>
<blockquote><p>If she wants to play, it will be for her to share,</p></blockquote>
<p>said Lindsay.</p>
<blockquote><p>She has the holidays to rest and decide what&#8217;s next without any pressure. She&#8217;s doing really, really well. She seems to have endured this in pretty incredible ways.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brittney hasn&#8217;t said anything public since she got out of jail, but Lindsay said that she should be ready to say something &#8220;this week.&#8221;</p>
<p>The athlete, who is 32 years old, also spent the weekend with her dad Ray and other family members, her agent said. The athlete also got a haircut.</p>
<p>Also, Brittney won&#8217;t go back to her home state of Arizona right away.</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s no timeline on her return at this point,</p></blockquote>
<p>continued Lindsay.</p>
<blockquote><p>She&#8217;s reintegrating into a world that has changed for her now. From a pure security standpoint she&#8217;s not going to be able to move in the world the way she did. It&#8217;s not a fate that she asked for, but I think she&#8217;s going to try to utilize her fame for good.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lindsay said that Brittney will work in the future to bring attention to the fact that some people are in jail when they shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>

<p>On December 9, the Phoenix Mercury Center arrived in the U.S. She was freed from Russian custody after she was traded for Viktor Bout, a Russian arms dealer who was 11 years into a 25-year sentence. President Joe Biden approved the trade, which sent Bout back to Russia.</p>
<p>Brittney was arrested at Moscow&#8217;s Sheremetyevo International Airport in February for allegedly having cannabis oil-filled vape cartridges in her luggage. She was held for almost a year. In August, a Russian court found the star guilty of drug charges and gave her a nine-year prison sentence.</p>
