<p>The Eastern Island heads are a popular natural discovery that the world knows about. The massive monoliths are among the famous sculptures in the world, recently someone found their hidden bodies underground.</p>
<p>Rapa Nui, or Easter Island, is a remote volcanic island located in Oceania&#8217;s Polynesian Triangle. It is known for a collection of over 1,000 stones statues that were made by Rapa Nui people between 1250 and 1500. Recently, the researchers found many hidden facts about the Eastern Island heads, including that they are full-length structures.</p>
<p>However, as uncovered by a team of archaeologists at UCLA, these sculptures are much more than busts. As a part of the Easter Island Statue Project, the team excavated two moai and discovered that each one had a body, proving, as the team excitedly explained in a letter, “that the ‘heads&#8217; on the slope here are, in fact, full but incomplete statues.”</p>
<h2>Did you know that the Easter Island heads have bodies?</h2>

<h2>Due to shifting soils, the bodies of many of the sculptures have been buried underground, giving the illusion that they are only heads.</h2>

<h2>However, as exhibited by the many moai who have not been buried, the island&#8217;s sculptures are actually full-length figures!</h2>
