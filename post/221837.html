			<p>TikTok is a place for various types of content. No boundaries shall restrict that platform and the users are well aware of this fact. One such user has called himself a <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/its-a-time-traveler-using-a-smart-phone-1995-mike-tyson-fight-video-has-people-confused/">time traveler</a> and made a gigantic claim that is amusing the Tiktokers. This holiday season is reportedly going to change its tone as &#8216;The Distants&#8217;, an <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/black-alien-is-considering-leg-amputation-after-having-ears-lips-and-fingers-sliced-off/">alien</a> race, are coming. Without a surprise, the said account is full of such claims.</p>
<p>The account called &#8216;timevoyaging&#8217; has 50 videos and its content has garnered more than 2.8 million likes. The time traveler claims that the Distants are an alien race that set up pyramids in each world they wanted to return to. Hence, when they come to us, they will start the First War of Earth. The account writes, &#8220;When they eventually come back to our planet, they will start the First War of Earth.&#8221; The video has more than 6,000 likes. The time traveler has claimed that Amazon and Tesla will join forces in 2023 to create a WiFi chip that will cure paralysis. One such claim is that James Cameroon&#8217;s &#8216;Avatar&#8217; film series is based on a real movie. Another striking claim is that humans, in the coming time, will look completely different and unrecognizable.</p>

<p>The news was a bummer to many users who decided to mock the credibility of the news. One user wrote, &#8220;It’s not gonna be a holly jolly Christmas anymore.&#8221; Another user mockingly commented, &#8220;Man not on Xmas, I want gifts not fear.&#8221; Another user said, &#8220;I don’t know about y’all but for me, that’d be the best Christmas present ever.&#8221; One user couldn&#8217;t help but bring logic into the picture and said, &#8220;I would love to believe this, but logic is pulling me back.&#8221; One more user commented, &#8220;The pyramids were made by the people of that region who had extensive knowledge of mathematics and engineering.&#8221;</p>
