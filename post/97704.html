			<p>Dogs are smart and full of energy. That is why they are employed in the police force or army. They are helpful in complicated tasks like search and rescue operations. Therefore, now they are working alongside humans and they never back down. They are always at our service. All they need is training and practice and a perfect employee is ready at your service.</p>
<p>But a dog&#8217;s job isn&#8217;t restricted to such services. Apparently, dogs are hired for such jobs we didn&#8217;t even know existed. Their jobs will put your career to shame and would make you think twice about your job.</p>
<p>Scroll and find how well they are doing.</p>
