			<p>As rumors spread about where the DC Universe will go now that James Gunn and Peter Safran are in charge, Gunn took to social media to tell fans that Superman is one of his top priorities.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey James, please tell us if we are gonna see a Superman?</p></blockquote>
<p>a fan asked Gunn on Twitter.</p>
<blockquote><p>We’ve been starved of the greatest comic book character on the big screen for ages!</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Yes of course,</p></blockquote>
<p>Gunn responded.</p>
<blockquote><p>Superman is a huge priority, if not the biggest priority.</p></blockquote>
<p>When asked by another fan to respond to the claim that &#8220;James Gunn doesn&#8217;t like Henry Cavill,&#8221; Gunn said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Sure: false.</p></blockquote>
<p>The DC Universe had been in a lot of trouble for a few days before Gunn replied. The news came out that Patty Jenkins quit &#8220;Wonder Woman 3&#8221; because she wouldn&#8217;t make the changes the studio wanted to her script treatment. There was also talk that the sequels to &#8220;Man of Steel&#8221; and &#8220;Black Adam&#8221; might not happen. Henry Cavill came back as Superman in the end credits scene of &#8220;Black Adam.&#8221; The actor also made the news official on social media. Then, a source said that Charles Roven was looking for writers to work on a new &#8220;Man of Steel&#8221; movie.</p>
<blockquote><p>The character means so much to me. It’s been five years now. I never gave up hope,</p></blockquote>
<p>Cavill said in an interview about returning as Superman.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s amazing to be here now talking about it again. There is such a bright future ahead for the character. I’m so excited to tell a story with an enormously joyful Superman.</p></blockquote>
<p>Henry Cavill may or may not be a part of Superman&#8217;s future in the DC Universe, but Gunn says that the character is a &#8220;huge priority.&#8221; J.J. Abrams and Ta-Nehisi Coates have also been working on a Superman movie for a long time, but it&#8217;s not clear what the status of that project is at this point.</p>
<blockquote><p>Peter and I chose to helm DC Studios knowing we were coming into a fractious environment, both in the stories being told and in the audience itself and there would be an unavoidable transitional period as we moved into telling a cohesive story across film, TV, animation and gaming,</p></blockquote>
<p>Gunn <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesGunn/status/1600920135237136385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted</a> on Dec. 8.</p>
<blockquote><p>We know we are not going to make every single person happy every step of the way, but we can promise everything we do is done in the service of the STORY and in the service of the DC CHARACTERS we know you cherish and we have cherished our whole lives,</p></blockquote>
<p>added Gunn.</p>
<blockquote><p>As for more answers about the future of the DCU, I will sadly have to ask you to wait. We are giving these characters and the stories the time and attention they deserve, and we ourselves still have a lot more questions to ask and answer.</p></blockquote>
