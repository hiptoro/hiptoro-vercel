<h2>The Emperor&#8217;s New Groove (2000)</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161906" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-119.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="482" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-119.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/1-119-300x207.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unknown, but The Emperor&#8217;s New Groove is a really slept-on Disney movie. Still to this day is one of the funniest animated movies ever made, IMO.</p>
<div id="post1" class="open-list-header">
<h2>Gattaca (1997)</h2>
</div>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161907" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-119.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="392" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-119.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-119-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-119-438x246.jpg 438w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2-119-255x144.jpg 255w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Gattaca. Hardly anyone I know has seen it. Ethan Hawke is superb and I love the film noir/sci-fi style of the movie.</p>
<h2>Ladyhawke (1985) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161908" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-119.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="329" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-119.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/3-119-300x141.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>Since the director (Donner) passed and I saw it mentioned a couple of times with him I’ll go with Ladyhawke. Rutger Hauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, and pre-Ferris Bueller Matthew Broderick.</p>
<h2>Idiocracy (2006) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161909" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-115.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="393" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-115.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-115-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-115-438x246.jpg 438w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-115-255x144.jpg 255w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4-115-350x198.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>Idiocracy. One of the funniest movies I’ve seen also terry cruise was in there</p>
<h2>The Cube (1997) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161910" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/5-113.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="383" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/5-113.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/5-113-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>The Cube.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a 1997 Canadian horror film directed by Vincenzo Natali. It&#8217;s nightmare fuel psychological horror about 5 people who woke up in a giant complex from which they have to escape.</p>
<p>Highly recommend it.</p>
<h2>The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide To The Galaxy (2005) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161911" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-110.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="344" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-110.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/6-110-300x147.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. A surprising amount of people I’ve met have never heard of it even.</p>
<h2>In Bruges (2008) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161912" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7-108.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="317" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7-108.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7-108-300x136.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>In Bruges, it’s an amazing film with great acting everything builds on the story and means something.</p>
<h2>Evolution (2001) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161913" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/8-104.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="368" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/8-104.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/8-104-300x158.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>Evolution. Its dumb but has some great comedic lines.</p>
<h2>Benny &amp; Joon (1993) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161914" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/9-97.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="403" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/9-97.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/9-97-300x173.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>Benny and Joon. It’s my favorite movie. It’s got a very young Johnny Depp as the lead role. He falls in love with a mentally ill girl names Joon who is taken care of by her older brother Benny. He bends over backward for her and makes her laugh with his silly antics. He plays kind of a young Charlie Chaplin role.</p>
<h2>The &#8216;Burbs (1989) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161915" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/10-99.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="461" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/10-99.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/10-99-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>The Burbs, it has so many good quotes and it’s sad when no one ever knows what I’m talking about.</p>
<h2>The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty (2013) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161916" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/11-94.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="332" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/11-94.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/11-94-300x142.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. It always makes me want to travel and live a little deeper.</p>
<h2>Time Bandits (1981) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161917" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/12-93.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="425" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/12-93.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/12-93-300x182.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>This may not be unknown enough to qualify, but Terry Gilliam&#8217;s &#8220;Time Bandits&#8221; &#8211; incredible cast and just an all-around great Gilliam fantasy, especially for anyone interested in world history.</p>
<h2>Chronicles Of Riddick (2004) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161918" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/13-87.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="396" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/13-87.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/13-87-300x170.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/13-87-255x144.jpg 255w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/13-87-350x198.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>Chronicles of Riddick. I don&#8217;t fully understand why I love it as much as I do. But the movie has some of the best/cheesiest/funniest 1 liners I&#8217;ve ever heard. While also just being very entertaining. I liked Pitch Black before it also has some classic 1 liners. And Riddick after was a failed attempt at combining both movies before it.</p>
<h2>The 13th Warrior (1999) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161919" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14-90.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14-90.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14-90-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14-90-438x246.jpg 438w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14-90-255x144.jpg 255w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/14-90-350x198.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>E4punisher suggested:<br />
The 13th Warrior. It got bad reviews, but I think it’s a fun movie to watch.</p>
<p>BlacksmithNZ responded:<br />
Great movie and there are a few memorable scenes.</p>
<p>One that blew me away was Antonio&#8217;s character who is smart but can&#8217;t speak the language of the other 12. From memory, the Vikings are not translated.. as somebody watching the movie you are like the 13th and not understanding what they are saying.</p>
<p>He tags along on a longish journey just listening to the others chat, swear and abuse him. Then he suddenly swears back as he has figured out enough of the language. At that point the all the characters speak the same language.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of another movie that dealt with characters not understanding other characters&#8217; language like this.</p>
<h2>Moulin Rouge! (2001) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161920" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/15-86.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="393" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/15-86.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/15-86-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/15-86-438x246.jpg 438w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/15-86-255x144.jpg 255w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/15-86-350x198.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>Moulin Rouge. Everyone that I ask to watch it with me says it’s weird as hell and too zany to follow. But I love it! Songs and all!</p>
<h2>The Man From U.N.C.L.E. (2015) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161921" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16-83.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16-83.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16-83-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16-83-438x246.jpg 438w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16-83-255x144.jpg 255w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16-83-350x198.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>Not sure how much this counts, but The Man From U.N.C.L.E.. It great comedy/spy movie that did surprisingly poorly in theaters. Definitely recommend a watch.</p>
<h2>Better Off Dead (1985) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161922" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17-78.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="523" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17-78.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/17-78-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>Better Off Dead. An 80s teen comedy staring John Cusack in which he repeatedly tries to commit suicide (humorously), has cartoon/claymation animated hallucinations set to Van Halen, has to win a ski competition to woo his ex, and is relentlessly stalked by a young paperboy over 2 dollars. It’s incredibly goofy and one of my favorite 80s movies of all time.</p>
<p>And there is also a pop-punk band named after the protagonist that has clips from the movie in most of their songs.</p>
<h2>Farscape (1999) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161923" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/18-74.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="529" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/18-74.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/18-74-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>It’s not a movie but it’s a show called Farscape. I’m born in 96 so I’m not sure how popular Farscape was back in the day, but.. I loved that s@#t.</p>
<h2>The Rocketeer (1991) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161924" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19-74.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="403" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19-74.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/19-74-300x173.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>The Rocketeer, simply a fantastic superhero movie from the early &#8217;90s.</p>
<h2>Train To Busan (2016) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161925" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20-68.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="433" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20-68.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20-68-300x186.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>Train to Busan. People refuse to watch it because of subtitles.</p>
<h2>Reign Of Fire (2002) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161926" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/21-59.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/21-59.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/21-59-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>Reign of Fire is the t@#s and I never hear it talked about.</p>
<h2>Rat Race (2001) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161927" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/22-55.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="407" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/22-55.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/22-55-300x174.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>Rat Race. The movie is hysterical with a great cast. Maybe it’s popular but I’ve never heard anyone talk about it, even when it came out in theaters.</p>
<h2>Lucky Number Slevin (2006) <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-161928" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/23-51.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="471" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/23-51.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/23-51-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></h2>
<p>Lucky Number Slevin.</p>
<p>No idea how to describe it. It&#8217;s not really a mob movie, although the main character is mixed up two mob bosses, a hitman, dirty NYC cops, and a horserace 20 years before that got an entire family wiped out. But it&#8217;s a solid &#8220;wtf is going on here??&#8221; With an all-star cast: Josh Hartnett, Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Stanley Tucci, Lucy Liu.</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Magorium&#8217;s Wonder Emporium is sweet, The Brother&#8217;s Bloom is &#8230; odd, but worth watching, and Across the Universe is one of the best musicals ever.</p>

<p>The Quick And The Dead is, without doubt, the most underrated action movie of the &#8217;90s. think enter the dragon or bloodsport but replace martial arts with a quick draw tournament in the old west. starring the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio and Russel Crowe before they were famous and directed by Sam Raimi, with all his directing style trademarks in full glory. It&#8217;s a highly, highly entertaining movie.</p>

<p>Return to OZ</p>
<p>I read all the OZ books as a kid and this is much closer to the feel than the Wizard of Oz movie with Garland. I love how dark it is, and to this day it&#8217;s one of my favorite movies.</p>

<p>I can only speak from experiences in my country and friends I have talked to.</p>
<p>Hardly anyone here has seen Donnie Yen in the Ip Man movies, or any of his other work really</p>

<p>Mrs. Pettigrew Lives for a Day</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cute, feel-good movie with a surprisingly high-caliber cast.</p>

<p>Only Lovers Left Alive. Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston as vampires. Sexy film. Fantastic music.</p>

<p>ParaPixie suggested:<br />
Crimson Peak with Tom Hiddleston. Very thrilling. It&#8217;s Tim Burton meets Loki meets Alice in Wonderland&#8230; But with Murder!</p>
<p>very practical side responded:<br />
Beware of Crimson Peak!</p>
<p>I hate horror movies, and I hate (-insert the theme of that one awkward part you-know-what-I&#8217;m-talking-about-) but that movie.</p>
<p>A feast for the eyes, practical effects and costumes to die for, badass lead woman, every character treated so lovingly by Guillermo del Toro to let their personal reveals/developments build and shine&#8230;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a reason we watch it every Halloween. It is thrilling, and it does transport you.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just Googled it and have been informed that the critic score for it is a mere 6.5&#8230;uncultured swine, I tell you.</p>
