			<p>Allison Holker is back on social media after the death of her husband, Stephen &#8220;tWitch&#8221; Boss. In her first post since his death, she paid tribute to him.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the dancer posted a picture of the two of them to Instagram with the words,</p>
<blockquote><p>My ONE and ONLY Oh how my heart aches. We miss you so much.</p></blockquote>
<p>Her outfit looks like what she was wearing in the last video of them dancing, which she posted on December 11, two days before he died.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles County Medical Examiner says that Boss took his own life when he was 40 years old.</p>

<p>Allison Holker&#8217;s post got a lot of support right away from the family&#8217;s famous friends and fans. Ellen DeGeneres was one of the first people to say something. She wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>There is so much love coming to you. I hope you can feel it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The show&#8217;s executive producer, Andy Lassner, also said,</p>
<blockquote><p>So much love. We got you</p></blockquote>
<p>while Kalen Allen wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>we&#8217;ll take care of you all from now and forever more!</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Dancing with the Stars&#8221; alum Peta Murgatroyd wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>sending you all the love Allison,</p></blockquote>
<p>while Derek Hough added,</p>
<blockquote><p>We love you Ally. We all have you üôèüèº&#8221; His fiancee Hayley Erbert also shared, &#8220;Sending you and your family SO much love üíóüíó.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>We got you and the children Sis.. He knows that!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</p></blockquote>
<p>commented Loni Love, while Ricki Lake wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>Holding and your babies close in my heart.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tamar Braxton, Jonathan Bennett, Larsa Pippen, and Sasha Farber all sent their support as well.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Boss&#8217;s mother, Connie Boss Alexander, also paid tribute to her son by posting a screenshot of a FaceTime call she had with him before he died.</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh if only I could FT to heaven&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>she captioned the photo.</p>
<p>Before Allison Holker and Boss got married in 2013, Boss took in Holker&#8217;s 14-year-old daughter, Weslie. They had two more children: a son, Maddox, who is 6 years old, and a daughter, Zaia, who is 3 years old. Boss and Allison Holker&#8217;s wedding anniversary was earlier this month. They have been married for nine years.</p>
<p>After he died, Allison Holker put out a statement that said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is with the heaviest of hearts that I have to share my husband Stephen has left us.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Stephen lit up every room he stepped into. He valued family, friends and community above all else and leading with love and light was everything to him,</p></blockquote>
<p>she wrote.</p>
<blockquote><p>He was the backbone of our family, the best husband and father, and an inspiration to his fans.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>To say he left a legacy would be an understatement, and his positive impact will continue to be felt,</p></blockquote>
<p>Allison Holker continued.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am certain there won&#8217;t be a day that goes by that we won&#8217;t honor his memory. We ask for privacy during this difficult time for myself and especially for our three children.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Stephen, we love you, we miss you, and I will always save the last dance for you,</p></blockquote>
<p>Holker concluded.</p>
