			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What on the earth is better than food? Can you name anything? Probably, you can’t because there is nothing better than freshly baked cookies &amp; cupcakes or pizza or anything else. See, just the thought of food can water the mouth. That’s the power of food. This is why our furry friend wants everything that we are eating (literally everything). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever they see us eating anything, they shamelessly stand near us, stare at us with their glittery eyes so that we share a bite of food with them. Hopefully, none of the pet parents mind this silly thing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And today we are going to talk about both our priority i.e. food and dogs. Some people with really good photoshop skills have come up with brilliant and unique ideas of placing dog photos on exotic food items. Sounds interesting, right? Of course. So scroll down and see the amazing pictures. </span></p>
