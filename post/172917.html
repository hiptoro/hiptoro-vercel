			<p>So many characters come and go in Saturday Night Live but some of them become memorable. These types of <a href="http://www.ranker.com/list/the-best-saturday-night-live-sketches-of-the-1990s/best-of-snl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rare<span class="edS-i"> SNL</span> signature characters</a> are written from a unique perspective. And most importantly, they pull off what&#8217;s written.</p>
<p>Characters like Bill Hader as Stefon, Kristen Wiig as Target Lady, Church Lady, and Molly Shannon as Mary Katherine Gallagher have impressed us all. This post especially features Chris Farley&#8217;s Matt Foley character that is considered as one of his career highlights.</p>

<p>Odenkirk revealed on <span class="edS-i">The View</span> that he had heard Farley do the <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-matt-foley-chris-farley-bob-odenkirk-20170215-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foley voice</a> in a different Second City sketch. “He had done a voice like that in an improv sketch, he was like a coach&#8230; and it was just a go-to voice for him,” Odenkirk said. “And I went and wrote this thing about a guy living in his van down by the river and he just [slayed] it every night. It was an amazing thing to see.”</p>
<h2 class="Title_title__2aoq1">‘Matt Foley’ Was The Name Of A Pastor Who Was Farley’s Real-Life Friend And Classmate At Marquette</h2>
<p>&#8220;Most of us, we&#8217;re much more complex than people portray us to be,&#8221; Father Foley says in the 2015 documentary <a href="https://www.amazon.com/I-Am-Chris-Farley-DVD/dp/B00XZZMTOM" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span class="edS-i">I Am Chris Farley</span></a>. &#8220;There&#8217;s the public persona and then there&#8217;s the person you know as a family member and a friend. Chris was that character people think he was, but he was not that character all the time. He also had a reflective side, a spiritual side, and a very caring side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farley called Foley hours before the sketch first aired in May 1993 to give him a heads-up. &#8220;Matt Foley is going to be on tonight,” Farley said. “You&#8217;ve got to watch it.”</p>
<h2 class="Title_title__2aoq1">There’s Early Footage Of Farley Performing The Nearly Fully-Formed Character At Second City With Odenkirk</h2>

<h2 class="Title_title__2aoq1">The Character Was First Introduced To A National Audience In 1993, Three Years After Farley Joined ‘SNL’</h2>
<p>“It <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/11/how-we-killed-chris-farley-with-laughter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked really well</a>, but it inaugurated this trend of Chris being really clumsy and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RWtLAsVdGg&amp;t=40s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falling down a lot</a>,” Smigel said. “That sort of broad clumsiness was actually the opposite of what Chris’s talents as a physical comedian were.”</p>

<p>&#8220;In rehearsal, he&#8217;d done the thing with his glasses&#8230; But he&#8217;d never done the twisting his belt and hitching up the pants thing,&#8221; Spade said. &#8220;He saved that for the live performance, and so none of us had ever seen it. He knew that would break me.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="Title_title__2aoq1">According To Odenkirk, The Key To The Character Is That He Feels Like A Real Person</h2>
<p>That character is telling a story with that catchphrase. It paints a picture; the phrase has a lot more meaning to it than just a catchphrase that stands alone. That sketch contains a very strong idea: that this guy uses his own tragic career path as fodder for his motivational speaker bit. But there is a lot more to it when Chris did it, and he made that character whole. It’s not a gimmick. You felt like there was a real person in that character.</p>

<p>“I told Chris and the writers, ‘Look. Whatever you do, the one thing to remember is: Don’t start from the ending.
