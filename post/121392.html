<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Have you ever seen a Bison crossing a road in its designated crossing area? We know it’s not huge but it&#8217;s something that people usually do not see. And if you have also never seen a Bison crossing a road, you are going to see one today. Yay!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This amazing picture was captured by a talented Canadian wildlife photographer Tim Osborne. The picture was taken in late December when he was driving near Elk Island National Park. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice to see that the Parks Canada staff have successfully trained the bison to use their marked crossings!” Osborne wrote while posting the picture. He further explains “I certainly don’t mess around when it comes to something like the bison. They seem pretty tame, but I wouldn’t want to get on their bad side.”</span></p>
