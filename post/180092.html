			Petition to ‘Stop Interviewing’ Will and Jada Pinkett Smith Has Received Over 13,500 Signatures

			<img src='https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/will.png' />
			<p>We are always interested in celebrities&#8217; life. Like we want to know everything. Literally everything. From whom they are dating, what they eat, their skincare secret, where they are going, their next big movie to their family history of diseases… You got the point, right?</p>
<p>But there is a thing. It&#8217;s that we don&#8217;t want to get updates from every celebrity. And when it comes to <a href="https://tiphero.com/will-smith-opens-up-about-his-unconventional-marriage-with-jada-pinkett-smith">Will and Jada Pinkett Smith</a>, we want it to stop. No. More. Interviewing.</p>
<p>You might not believe this, but there is, in fact, <a href="https://www.change.org/p/les-plateaux-tv-stop-interviewing-will-and-jada-smith?redirect=false">a Change.org petition</a> created. This petition initially wanted 5000 people to sign so that the media would stop interviewing the couple. But it turns out more than 5000 people wanted to stop this interview.</p>
<p>After this petition was started by the original creator, Dexter Morales, it reached 11,000 signed by midday. That&#8217;s when the target of this petition shifted to 15,000.</p>
<p>In the petition, people can leave their reasoning behind their signature. Here are just a few:</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything I learn about this couple is against my will. Free us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sick and tired of hearing the BS that goes on in their personal lives. It&#8217;s exhausting. I&#8217;ve muted their names everywhere AND STILL SEE THIS!! … Make it STOP!!!&#8221;</p>
<div class="ad_ph inline-google-ad-slot below-p">
<div id="Article_Repeat_1" data-google-query-id="CNvUxdSo0vQCFQymjwodhe4Mkw">
<p>&#8220;They keep shoving their personal lives down our throats, and frankly, we do not care! Attention seeking is a mental illness, and they need to get help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned more about this family in the past three months than I have in the last ten years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;M TIRED OF HEARING THESE GODDAMN STORIES!&#8221;</p>
<p>Whew—is that reason enough?</p>
</div>
<p>Well, the number of petition signs clearly shows that this couple is telling out details about their life, which no one wants to know. The series of the neverending interview started when Will Smith appeared on Good Morning America and said that he and Jada are working on &#8220;unconditional love&#8221; and &#8220;are pursuing the kind of love that everybody dreams about. And we just know that the road doesn&#8217;t look like everybody thinks it&#8217;s supposed to look. But… don&#8217;t try this at home, children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, in a GQ cover story, Will said that Jada wasn&#8217;t &#8220;the only one engaging in other sexual relationships.&#8221; He then explained, &#8220;We have given each other trust and freedom, with the belief that everybody has to find their way. And marriage for us can&#8217;t be a prison.&#8221;</p>
