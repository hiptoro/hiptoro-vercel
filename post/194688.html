			<h2>We know that life is full of surprises and there have been times when we were pleasantly surprised. When a couple welcomed a set of rare biracial twins, they were stunned. The beautiful family made headlines again after seven years.</h2>

<p>Alison Spooner and Dean Durrant look like a normal couple, but their genetic material is different. The miracle occurred not just one set of twins, but two sets of twins.</p>
<p>Alison is white-skinned with blue eyes and red hair, but her partner Dean is West Indian. Dean has brown hair and eyes. When the couple first learned that Alison was pregnant with twins, they were expecting their babies to take after both of them. The parents were surprised when Alison gave birth to Laura and Hayleigh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-194693" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7623455234554238243.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="269" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7623455234554238243.jpg 512w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7623455234554238243-300x158.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the twins was white and the other was black. The girls were often asked to show their IDs as proof of their relations as they grew up, according to their parents.</p>
<p>Alison found herself pregnant again almost seven years later, with another set of twins. The babies were in the breech position when Alison was in the hospital. The babies were rushed to intensive care due to breathing problems and Alison and Dean didn&#8217;t get a chance to see them.</p>
<p>When the couple looked at their new babies, they realized they had another set of miracle biracial twins. Miya was born with her father&#8217;s darker features, while her sister had white skin and light features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-194692" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7862345234582348234.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="495" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7862345234582348234.jpg 512w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7862345234582348234-300x290.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dean said that he has no words to explain his happiness. He said that they are both still in shock and can&#8217;t believe it happened to them again.</p>
<p>Two of their sisters have been able to help them through the challenges. When they grow up, they want to be like their sister. Despite their physical differences, they are similar in many ways.</p>

<p>They have different likes and dislikes but the bond between them is strong.</p>
