<p>Crows have always been associated with mounting and bad things in movies for many decades.</p>

<p>It turns out that these creatures are highly intelligent, something which is out of our imagination. To find out more details about them Hiptoro reached out to Steve Portugal, a comparative ecophysiologist and professor of Animal Physiology and Behaviour at Royal Holloway, University of London.</p>
<p>We asked him about the theory of feeding crows to which he had to say, “Firstly, bird tables and feeders need to be cleaned regularly to avoid disease transmission. Secondly, any time a wild animal becomes habituated and accustomed to humans, there is a risk they become a little comfortable in residential areas, possibly eating the wrong diet, or becoming a nuisance if they make an association between humans and food.”</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-132468 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11-18.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="367" /></p>

<p>“Crows, as part of the Corvid family, are highly intelligent animals,” Steve said and added that “Corvids as a group are some of the most intelligent animals on the planet.” That states that they are capable of recognizing individuals over long periods of time.</p>
<p>In that sense, Steve confirmed that it’s indeed possible to befriend crows as “an individual could build a relationship with crows if they interact regularly in a positive way.”</p>
<h2>And this is what people had to say about it</h2>

<p>Steve was asked was crows become aggressive overtime, to which he replied “They would build an expectation, through conditioning, that humans equal food. It’s possible, therefore, that if the crows approach a human who then doesn’t provide food, confusion then leads to aggression.”</p>

<p>Researchers have recently found out that crows have the capability of forming lasting memories.</p>

<p>So, if you are intending to befriend a crow, your way to reach their heart is through their stomach.</p>
