			<p>Dog owners whose pets go missing can understand the intense fear of losing the thing that you love the most. Recently a dog walks into the police station. And reports himself missing as the dog went missing in Odessa, Texas.</p>
<p>Usually, when your pet gets missing you become very tense. But something extraordinary happened here.</p>
<p>When a dog gets freedom it uses the advantage to its full. But instead of enjoying the freedom this dog very cleverly went to the nearest local police station and handed himself. It is rather strange, but this happened.</p>

<h3>In the early hours of a cold February morning in Texas, somebody arrived at the Odessa Police Department to report a missing dog in the local area.</h3>
<p>However, the best past was the person reporting about the missing dog was the dog himself. Suddenly, he dropped himself on the desk and gave his best smile to all the police officers. Although he was away from his owner, he seems to be quite happy and was in a playful mode.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We were all excited to have him in the building,” Sergeant Rusty Martin told The Dodo. “We had a tennis ball and threw it in the lobby for a bit. Everyone loved on him.”</p></blockquote>

<h3>Despite enjoying the company of their new pooch, officers turned their attention to the matter at hand.</h3>
<p>Who did this dog belong to, and where had he come from? According to the people police station, the dog was having a collar tag but unfortunately, his ID tag was missing. For the same reason, they were unable to identify the dog and his owner.</p>
<p>They immediately called the Animal Control who then arrived to check whether the dog was having a microchip or not. But even before the arrival of Animal Control team the dog walked out of the police station and disappeared into the night.</p>
<p>Little did the police were aware but the dog was actually heading towards its home. He had enough of hanging around that day.</p>

Martin posted about the incident on Facebook, and the next day the owner got in touch.</p>
<blockquote><p> “He ran out just as quick as he came in,” Martin said. “The owner responded the next day [to say that] it was his dog and he had returned home. He lives about a mile from the station.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The name of the dog was Chico. The police department soon shared the post as-</p>
<blockquote><p> “So…. this happy guy randomly strolled into the front desk of the Police Department last night. We’re thinking he wanted to apply for a K-9 position after eliminating a Lassie type situation. He was given lots of love and attention until he decided it was time for him to leave. He let himself out and after an exhausting search was not found. We were relieved to learn he safely returned to his owner. Chico is welcome back anytime.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What a relief that Chico made it back home again. We hope that he doesn’t have to make any more trips to the police station in the future! Share your experience if you anything similar like this happened to you.</p>
