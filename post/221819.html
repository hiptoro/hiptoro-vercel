			<p>Reporting is not an easy job. Iowa TV <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/us-reporter-detained-for-nearly-half-an-hour-because-of-a-rainbow-on-his-t-shirt-at-world-cup/">sports reporter</a> Mark Woodley proves the saying due to his recent reporting experience which did not go quite as planned. Woodley was asked to cover a storm on Thursday and his reporting could not get any better. He&#8217;s the only reporter who got love for being cranky. What&#8217;s better, he posted the best section of his segment on his on <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/samuel-l-jackson-caught-liking-x-rated-videos-on-twitter-on-his-74th-birthday/">Twitter</a> page to tell everyone that he is owning it.</p>
<p>Woodley begins, &#8220;What better time to ask the sports guy to come in about five hours earlier than he would normally wake up, go stand out in the wind and the snow and the cold and tell other people not to do the same?&#8221; The sarcasm continues and he says, &#8220;I didn’t even realize that there was a 3:30 also in the morning — until today. Tune in for the next couple hours to watch me progressively get crankier and crankier.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Hilarious sports reporter goes viral for storm full of complaints</h2>
<p>The KWWL reporter in Waterloo went viral after he was made to report about the arctic temperatures. Woodley then says, &#8220;I’ve got good news, and I’ve got bad news. The good news is that I can still feel my face right now. The bad news is I kind of wish I couldn’t.&#8221; Woodley explained, &#8220;I normally do sports and everything is canceled here for the next few days.&#8221; His hilarious comments provided lush entertainment to his viewers who were absolutely in love with him.</p>

<p>One person commented, &#8220;Big mistake, Woodley. You shouldn’t have been so good at this.&#8221; Another user quipped, &#8220;Dude that was awesome, best weather reporting I’ve seen. You should come to Florida for a hurricane and walk past the other weather reporters as they paddle a canoe in 6 inches of water!&#8221; One more user commented, &#8220;Who would have thought sarcasm is the way to report weather?&#8221;</p>
