			<p>Whoopi Goldberg&#8217;s business stays in the hands of Whoopi Goldberg. On the latest episode of The View, a co-host blasted the media and the internet for sharing private information about her life. She was upset that her age, birthday, and full name were all over the internet.</p>
<p>In a deal with GLAAD and SAG-AFTRA, IMDb will now let people in the film and TV industry choose not to put their age or birth name on the film and TV database. This news got people talking. At first, Goldberg didn&#8217;t seem to care about what was going on. She said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; but it soon became clear that she did care a little more than she let on.</p>
<p>She continued,</p>
<blockquote><p>All that information is out there. I don’t like that it says, well, ‘they’ve agreed to allow industry professionals.’ You haven’t agreed to allow me to do anything. I asked you not to print it, and you printed it anyway. Why am I happy that 40 years later you’ve made a change?</p></blockquote>
<p>Sunny Hostin said that women&#8217;s ages are more often flagged than men&#8217;s, but Goldberg said,</p>
<blockquote><p>they do it to everybody.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t print my personal information,</p></blockquote>
<p>she continued.</p>
<blockquote><p>If I don’t ask you to print it, why are you doing it? Cause you think you have the right. This is the point that, for me, unless you can fix that, explaining to people that you don’t have the right to have this information unless I share it with you,</p></blockquote>
<p>she paused to collect herself, before adding,</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m sure this is great for other people. I’m just bitching because I’m old.</p></blockquote>
<p>Joy Behar then talked about a time &#8220;years ago&#8221; when she was talking to <span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong>People</strong></span> magazine for a story and asked them not to print her age. She said the magazine told her that they would find out her age through the DMV anyway.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s out of your hands,</p></blockquote>
<p>she said.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s absolutely sinful that they do it.</p></blockquote>
