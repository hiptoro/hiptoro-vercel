			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a sweet story of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lisianne who found a black furry cat wandering near her home. When she saw the cat, she thought of helping her. So, she brought the hungry cat inside her house and gave her a bowl full of water and food. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, she named the cat Usagi and the two of them began to develop a deep bond. </span></p>

<h2>Usagi’s Belly Began To Grow</h2>
<p>Lisianne then realized that her cat&#8217;s belly has started growing big (and it is not because of food).</p>
<p>“With this routine, the lady gained confidence and the kitty started getting close,” a local rescue group, named Chatons Orphelins Montréal, wrote on Facebook. “The kitty gave birth outside, but she came back every day to eat.”</p>
<h2>Mother Cat Introduced Her Family</h2>
<p>After a week, sweet Usagi decided to introduce Lisianne to her adorable and little family.</p>

<h2>Lisianne Called Rescue Group</h2>
<p>Seeing them, Lisianne took them inside her house and called the rescued group for help.</p>
<p>“The mom and her six babies were finally safe,” Chatons Orphelins Montréal wrote. “[Lisianne] decided to keep the mom [and] treated and spayed her and one of her friends took one of the kittens under her wing.”</p>

<h2>They Recovered</h2>
<p>“The babies were reserved, they needed socialization,” Chatons Orphelins Montréal said. “They started trusting and coming out of their shell. The little ones love having fun together.”</p>
