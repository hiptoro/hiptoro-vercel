			<p>David Beckham, a former professional football player from England who is now president of Inter Miami CF and co-owner of Salford City, said that his wife, Victoria, has been eating the same dish for the past 25 years.</p>
<p>Beckham said on the River Café Table 4 Podcast that his wife only likes to eat grilled fish and steamed vegetables and doesn&#8217;t like to try new foods.</p>

<blockquote><p>I get quite emotional about food and wine, when I’m eating something great I want everyone to try it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I’m married to someone that has eaten the same thing for the last 25 years. Since I met her she only eats grilled fish, and steamed vegetables, she will very rarely deviate from that.</p></blockquote>
<p>he said.</p>
<p>The soccer player also said that Victoria had only tried something other than her usual meal when she was expecting their daughter.</p>

<blockquote><p>The only time she’s probably ever shared something that’s been on my plate was actually when she was pregnant with Harper and it was the most amazing thing.</p>
<p>It was one of my favorite evenings. I can’t remember what it was but I know she’s not eaten it since,</p></blockquote>
<p>he told host Ruthie Rogers.</p>
<p>David also said that he likes to stay at home and try out new recipes in the kitchen.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pretty recently I was in isolation for five days because I’d just been to Italy so I came back, and on one of the last days, Victoria’s parents had a party, and I couldn’t actually go to it.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>So everyone was out of the house, and I secretly loved it. I literally had two most amazing cuts of meat. One was a T-bone and I had some English wagyu.</p>
<p>I poured one glass of the most amazing red wine that I treated myself to because I was on my own looking forward to watching the football in the afternoon on my own. So I set the barbecue up,</p></blockquote>
<p>he continued.</p>
<blockquote><p>I had a nice tomato and shallot salad and the meat and a glass of wine and it was the most amazing meal that I had for a long time. Those are my most amazing afternoons and evenings.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fashion designer said in one of her interviews for the same podcast that she never eats oily food and never cooks her meals in butter or any other sauce.</p>

<blockquote><p>To most restaurants, I’m probably their worst nightmare. I love some steamed vegetables, some balsamic vinegar, and then to season myself.</p>
<p>I like things to be cooked in a very simple way. I don’t like oil or butter or sauces. This is where I sound even more boring in the food department.</p></blockquote>
<p>The singer and TV host, who is 48 years old, also said that a piece of whole-grain toast with salt is her favorite comfort food.</p>
<blockquote><p>I like whole grain toast with salt on it. It’s that carbohydrate that makes you feel comforted, and I love salt. I don’t like fancy cakes; on my birthday every year, I have a piece of fruit cake and call it a day.</p></blockquote>
