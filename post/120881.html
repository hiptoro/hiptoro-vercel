			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are you a Star Wars fan? Well, guess what? Even we like it a lot. Surely, Star Wars is a big deal and people around the world are crazy about it. But calling it a religion is not true, right? However, people leave no occasion of putting a religious spin to Star Wars. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like there is this guy who has gifted his Mormon parents something extremely artistic. Actually, he has given them an artistic interpretation of </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Jesus Christ… Yes, you have read that right! To be more specific, this guy has given his parents a portrait of Obi-Wan Kenobi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scroll down to have a look. </span></p>
<h2>Ever grew up in a religious family who loved to have portraits of Jesus Christ around the house?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-120882 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-14.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" /></p>
<p>This guy is Ryan Buchanan and he has the most mischievous mind in the world. Back in Christmas of 2018, he has given his religious parents a portrait saying that it&#8217;s an artistic picture of Jesus.</p>
<h2>Well, that ain’t no Jesus, that’s Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but someone did actually hang it as a painting on their wall thinking it’s Jesus</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-120883 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2-13.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="875" /></p>
<p>Ryan has gifted this portrait to his parents on Christmas eve covered with polka dot gift wrap. When his parents opened the gift, they told him that they have never such a picture before. They thought that the picture was of Jesus but it was actually an actor. He was the actor who portrayed Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars, i.e., Ewan Gordon McGregor, wearing the iconic Jedi attire.</p>
<h2>Ryan Buchanan gifted the portrait of Obi-Wan to his religious Mormon parents for Christmas</h2>

<h2>The parents bought it and were very happy with the portrait—so much in fact that it ended up on their wall</h2>

<p>“I’ve made a huge mistake. Mom loves her Jesus Christmas present and I’m not sure how to get out of this thing alive when she figures out.”</p>
<h2>Despite his mischievous smile, Ryan is now thinking about what will happen to him once his parents find out the truth!</h2>

<h2>Believe it or not, this is actually a thing as another person swapped their Jesus picture for Obi-Wan too</h2>

<h2>There was even one time when a Mormon Sunday program was also designed to include Obi-Wan</h2>

<h2>Take a look at the video Ryan posted of his parents unwrapping the gift</h2>
