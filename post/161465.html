			<h2>If you think cats don’t care about us, think again.</h2>
<p>Cats are known to be acting like they are the boss. They pretend that they don&#8217;t want to seek your attention, but the truth is that they really seek love and affection. When a cat wants your attention, it will act weirdly and make you believe that they are not comfortable or sick. Some people took the liberty to share incidents on the internet about their cats acting like a child to seek attention and love. Scroll down and check out these stories.</p>
