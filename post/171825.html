			<p>Erin Breean was walking back home with her dog and her boyfriend when she encountered a strange cat that kept following her.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-171828 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="1293" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-169x300.jpg 169w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-577x1024.jpg 577w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>The cat looked very affectionate and appeared that it was well fed. It seemed that the cat belonged to someone. Erin&#8217;s dog arrived where she and her boyfriend were meet the cat. The cat tried to attack Erin&#8217;s dog when her boyfriend separated them from each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;He came up to us and was rubbing our ankles (…). The cat sat with me the whole time, rubbing me and rolling on his bell, and he was very kind,&#8221; – Breean told Hiptoro.</p>
<p>Breean took lots of cat pictures to upload them on Austin&#8217;s Facebook page for lost animals. The cat didn&#8217;t give up and kept following Erin everywhere she would go.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought, &#8216;Hey buddy, don&#8217;t follow me home if you live down the street or wherever your house is.'&#8221; – she said.</p>

<p>Erin thought for a while that Greg got her way back home, but in no time, they found him back in their backyard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-171833 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="1057" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5-207x300.jpg 207w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/5-705x1024.jpg 705w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>For the next four da, the cat didn&#8217;t give up and kept following the couple on the streets and their way back home.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-171834 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/6.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="970" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/6.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/6-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Finally, a volunteer from Austin Lost and Found Pets came to their house with a microchip scanner.  They were finally able to identify Greg&#8217;s human and managed to reunite the cat with his family.</p>
