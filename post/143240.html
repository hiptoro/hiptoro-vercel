			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our faith in the legal system might have been shaken because of the system’s inability to get things right but there are individuals who are doing something well within the system. There are individuals who make sure that innocent ones get justice and offenders get the right punishment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the list of such individuals, Michael Cicconetti, a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Painesville, Ohio judge, has become very popular. Actually, he is an animal-lover. So, he made it a point to punish animal abusers with a twist. He wants the abusers to understand and feel what the animals might have gone through while abusing. Thus, he gives them innovative punishment.</span></p>

<p>His punishment always has a hidden and valuable lesson for offenders to learn.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-143243 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-160.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<h2>Yet, despite the unusual nature of his sentencing, Cicconetti stays well within the confines of the law. And with the judge’s attempts to give perpetrators a dose of their own medicine, there does, in fact, appear to be a method to his madness.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-143244 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-157.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="364" /></p>

<p>At the hearing Cicconetti said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I can’t interpret the thoughts of a dog, but boy if dogs could tell you how they felt: abandoned, scared, frightened, and sick. Well, maybe you should get a little taste of that.”… I want you to sit there for eight hours tomorrow, to think about what you did to that dog while you smell the odour. If you puke, you puke.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Listen to the sentencing:</h2>

<h2>In another well-known case, the self-confessed animal lover and lifelong dog dad sentenced a woman who abandoned 35 kittens in the woods to spend a night out there on her own (as well as jail time and a fine).</h2>
<p>At the hearing Cicconetti again cited his reasoning;</p>
<blockquote><p>“How would you like to be dumped off at a metro park late at night, spend the night listening to the coyotes … listening to the raccoons around you in the dark night, and sit out there in the cold not knowing where you’re going to get your next meal, not knowing when you are going to be rescued?”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>“The message I want to send to the defendant is, ‘look, you did something stupid and you’re going to pay for it by doing something stupid. Hopefully, that clicks. I can’t say we didn’t have a little fun doing it over the years. We have. I’ve entertained myself by doing it. But there’s always been a point to doing it.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Internet users thought that the judge’s sentences were spot-on</h2>
