<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might have heard about hospice care for humans but have you ever thought about what hospice care for dogs might look like? If not, you are going to witness this wonderful thing in this post. So, stay tuned. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hospice care is for people who are living some of the last days of their life. And since dogs are also a part of the family, they also deserve to die with d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ignity. Don&#8217;t you agree? </span></p>
<p>Here are some of the adorable pictures.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This great initiative is started by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nicola Coyle, a retired nurse. She used to work in dog rescue and has started The Grey Muzzle Crannie Hospice. Nicola founded this center so that she can offer the best kind of care to the abandoned dogs. Awww!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be happy to know that she runs this amazing center from her own home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The furry angels come to this dog center from v</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">et surgeries, charities, and kennels. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know when their birthdays are so we throw all of them a birthday party,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They just want to feel loved and safe. I really believe they should get a nice ending.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you are wondering where the funds are coming from, you are in luck because we know it. Surprisingly, she spends approximately </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">£500 ($664.20) per dog from her own pocket. That’s truly amazing! Besides this, she also uses the funds that she gets. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Facebook description of this dog care page, it’s written: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">We provide end of life care for abandoned dogs. We take only dogs that are from UK pounds that have been deemed as having less than six months to live</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
