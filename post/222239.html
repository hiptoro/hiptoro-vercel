			<p>People who have seen the new Netflix movie <strong>Luckiest Girl Alive</strong> starring Mila <a href="https://youtu.be/KWIyEWmIPCc">Kunis</a> and called for a trigger warning to be shown before the movie starts have said that they agree.</p>
<p>In the movie, Ani&#8217;s (Kunis) life in New York City is almost perfect. But in the end, she has to face her past, and this is the part where a lot of people think there should be a trigger warning.</p>
<p>(Warning: This post contains spoilers and/or sensitive material.) It has come to light that when Ani was 14, she was raped by a gang. She also lived through a shooting at her school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>You can watch the trailer for the movie &#8220;Luckiest Girl Alive&#8221;&#8230;</h2>

<p>The movie Luckiest Girl Alive is based on a book of the same name that was written and published by Jessica Knoll in 2015.</p>
<p>Even though Netflix has warned users that Luckiest Film Alive has &#8220;sexual violence,&#8221; many viewers think that this is not enough given how graphic the movie is and that it should be made clearer that the movie has &#8220;intense scenes of sexual assault.&#8221;</p>
<p>One viewer shared:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why in the world does the movie Luckiest Girl Alive not have a trigger warning for s**ual assault?</p>
<p>It was extremely horrifying for me to watch that and caused a panic attack due to former trauma. DO BETTER AND FIX THIS!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>Another said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone thinking of watching the new Mila Kunis movie on Netflix Luckiest Girl Alivebe aware that there are graphic r*** scenes and also a huge emphasis on PTSD and trauma I feel the marketing for the movie hasn’t given these content warnings.</p></blockquote>
<p>They continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Netflix really need to start including content warnings at the start of some of their movies especially when these storylines have been kept out of trailers and marketing.</p></blockquote>
<p>A third viewer added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wow. Good job, Netflix on the trigger warning you didn’t provide on your Luckiest Girl Alive movie.</p>
<p>PSA for anyone who is gonna watch the movie, there are very graphic intense scenes of s**ual assault in this movie.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Warning about watching the <em>Luckiest Girl Alive</em> on Netflix. It’s pretty brutal about SA (s**ual assault) victims, and the scenes are,</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Luckiest Girl Alive on Netflix is…so good…but also pretty traumatizing. Very graphic scenes of r***/s**ual assault so watch with caution if you’re interested,</p></blockquote>
<p>warned another viewer.</p>
<p>Someone else shared:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey gang, quick heads up about Luckiest Girl Aliveon Netflix: the description says it’s about a school shooting, but the story is also very much about r*** and PTSD. It’s done very realistically and graphically.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though some viewers have asked the streaming giants to add a trigger warning, many viewers have praised the film <strong>Luckiest Girl Alive</strong> for its accurate portrayal of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and how traumatic events can affect a person&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>One person commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Luckiest Girl Alive on Netflix was such a great portrayal of what life is like before, during, and after a r***. For all survivors, this will hit hard.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Luckiest Girl Alive is the best depiction of Complex PTSD I’ve ever seen. A moving portrayal of coping with assault in a culture that protects the perpetrators,</p></blockquote>
<p>expressed another viewer.</p>
<p>A third said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This was such a powerful and important film and Mila did an incredible job wow.</p>
<p>It had some painfully accurate moments exploring trauma and grief.</p>
<p>The transitions between teen Ani and adult Ani were excellent. The ending was perfect. I loved it. Amazing film.</p></blockquote>
<p>The movie came out on October 7 and quickly climbed to the top of the list of the Top 10 Films that were available on Netflix in the United Kingdom at the time.</p>
<p>The Luckiest Girl Alive can be watched online right now through Netflix&#8217;s streaming service.</p>
