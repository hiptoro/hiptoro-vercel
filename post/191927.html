			<p>Did you know that the human brain has around <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-memory-capacity/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">one billion neurons</a>? And a single neuron is capable of forming about 1,000 connections to other neurons. So, if you do the maths, you will know that neurons are making up more than a trillion connections.</p>
<p>Wondering why are we giving you this information? Well, imagine if each neuron could only help store a single memory, you might have only a few gigabytes of storage space. But the interesting thing is that neurons combine so that each one helps with many memories at a time, exponentially increasing the brain&#8217;s memory storage capacity to something close to 2.5 petabytes (or a million gigabytes).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like your brain is a digital TV recorder. 2.5 petabytes, which can hold three million hours of TV shows — you could leave the TV running continuously for more than 300 years.</p>
<p>So, when our brain could store this much information, we should not waste it? That&#8217;s why today we have featured  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Today I Learned</a>, often shortened as TIL. It&#8217;s a Reddit community that has 25.9 million members. It constantly shares interesting trivia like the location of the clearest lake in the world or the reason why Nas listed his then 7-year-old daughter as an executive producer on his fifth album.</p>
<p>To put some of your 2.5 petabytes to good use, we rounded up some of the best posts we could find on the subreddit.</p>
