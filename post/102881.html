			<h2>Adopt, don’t shop!</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Want to take home a ball of sunshine, happiness, and love? Go adopt a dog. Yes, you have read it right. If you were thinking of getting a dog lately, you are suggested to adopt a pet from a shelter house rather than buying one from a breeder. It&#8217;s simply because the cute furballs in the shelter are waiting for a permanent home so long. And it is just us who can make this happen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you adopt a dog, you will not only give it a new home but will also save its life. How? Because there are so many kill shelters and no animal deserves to die. No matter what the breed is or how old the dog is, you can show your love. So if you want to live happier forever and ever, go adopt an adorable dog now. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scroll down to see how adoption can change a dog&#8217;s life.</span></p>
