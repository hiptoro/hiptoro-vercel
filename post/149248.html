			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We all want to stay fit and healthy. So, going to the gym has become a ritual. But there is a thing. It’s that sometimes women aren’t comfortable sharing </span><span style="font-weight: 400">the gym with men. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Keeping in mind this same thing, a gym in Kansas, US has made an all-female gym so that ladies can workout comfortably. A TikToker named Heather Huesman shared the video of this gym and it went viral. While some people like this gym, some men calling it ‘segregation.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scroll down to know more about it. And yes, don’t forget to share your thoughts on this gym that is created specifically for women to feel welcome and safe.</span></p>
<h2>Heather, a 23-year-old server, decided to share her experience attending a gym that is for female patrons only</h2>

<p>She didn’t expect the video to go viral to this extent: “I’m glad that we got the word out about it, though, because now women who have been planning on opening their own gym see how successful it can be! I heard people talking about all-women’s gyms, but I’d never actually seen one, so I thought this would be the perfect way to spread the word.”</p>
<h2>The windows are tinted so that no one walking by is able to see inside</h2>

<h2>The member gym is open 24/7 and it’s always locked with fob key access</h2>

<p>“The BEST GYM! We need these everywhere, we feel so safe and comfortable going to the gym, gonna be my new favorite spot!”</p>
<p>“I joined because going to the gym around men made me really nervous. I knew I wanted to go but I was scared of either being judged or looked at while I was there. Men also always take up ALL the machines! I definitely think it’s important. I feel so safe working out there, and we see too many videos of women being catcalled or having their photos taken while they’re at the gym. I think all-women’s, and even all-men’s gyms should be a thing In almost every city!”</p>
<h2>Menstrual products are free and available in the bathrooms</h2>

<h2>Other than well-thought-out details, the gym has all the regular equipment for exercise</h2>

<p>“When these members were asked about what was causing them to skip weight lifting workouts on their own, they all replied that they didn’t feel comfortable, felt judged, guys were looking at them, etc. From this feedback, Max began asking the female members how they would like it if they had a whole gym to themselves to weight-lift in. And they all loved the idea! A year later, we sold our Anytime Fitness and opened up BLUSH FITNESS.”</p>

<p>Heather thinks that “they just want something to be mad about, honestly. I would have no problem if I heard of an all-men’s gym. If men are mad that there’s such thing as an all-women’s gym, it’s because they feel the need to look at women while they’re there. However, I honestly don’t understand why it’s getting men so riled up when simply it’s to make women feel more comfortable going to the gym. Men can be really mean at the gym! This makes it feel like a safe space for women to start the first step on their journey.” And Kelly, the owner of Bliss Fitness, agreed with her. “Being called segregated is unfair because the need for a women-only gym is created by males, so what else are we supposed to do?” She also added that “Our mission is to provide a safe and comfortable workout environment for women and we strive to uphold that vision each and every day.”</p>
<h2>Most comments were supportive towards the idea of a women-only gym; however, some men were using the word ‘segregation’ and doubting its equality</h2>
