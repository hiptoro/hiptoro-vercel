			<p><strong>There are a couple of things that dogs’ take <i>v</i><em>ery seriously</em> in life, and one of them is their walks.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, that’s right and if you are a pet parent, you might be aware of this thing. Dogs actually have a fixed time table and you should follow it because these furry angels don’t like it when their human miss morning walks.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-109191 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-153.jpg" alt="" width="990" height="528" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankly speaking, even we like taking them on walkies because we get to spend so much time with them. But our never-ending life demands just makes it impossible for us to spend more and more time with our furry friend. And in such a situation, all we can imagine is of a perfect world. A world where our furry friends would take themselves for walks, meet their friend, and come home safely. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe it&#8217;s possible. Why? Because a Seattle based Labrador and Mastiff mix, Eclipse, is surely doing it. In fact, this cute and adorable doggo has become a local celebrity as she regularly takes the bus to go to the local dog park. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-109193 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-147.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the popularity of Eclipse started growing, several local news stations started reporting about this 2-year-old pooch. Everyone believed that this dog is a savvy stray that likes local parks. But the owner of this dog </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Young came forward to put the growing speculations to rest. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“All the bus drivers know her. She sits here just like a person does”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-109195 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-147.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff even told us when this all began. It all started the day when Jeff and Eclipse were on their way to park. Since Jeff was smoking a cigarette, his dog became impatient and mounted the bus without him. Soon after this, Jeff found her at the local park. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Her human was taking too long to finish his cigarette, so when the bus arrived, she got on it&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-109196 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-151.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Every day she leaves her house, by herself, and takes the bus downtown to the dog park where she spends a couple of hours getting exercise and making friends, and then she takes the bus back home again. She even has her own bus pass attached to the collar, Jeff said.</p>
<p>The canine get on the Bus all by herself every day&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-109197 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-146.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="392" /></p>
<p>That’s when Jeff realized his smart furry friend can ride those 3-4 stops on on her own</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-109199 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-139.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eclipse is also welcomed on the bus and her co-passengers kinda like her. </span></p>
<p>“All the bus drivers know her. She sits here just like a person does,” fellow commuter Tiona Rainwater said. “She makes everybody happy.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-109200 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/7-137.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="390" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-109201 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/8-137.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="393" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even after Eclipse has become so popular, people still contact Jeff as they think that she is lost.</span></p>
<p>Probably once a week I get a phone call. ‘Hi. I have your dog Eclipse here on 3rd and Bell.’ I have to tell them, ‘no. She’s fine.’ She knows what she’s doing.” Said, Jeff <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-109203 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9-137.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="420" /></p>
<p>&#8220;It makes their day,” A spokesman said. “It’s a good part of their day and it works out for her so I just let it go.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-109204 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/10-138.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="395" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-109205 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/11-134.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" /></p>
<p>You can watch the video to see how amazingly Eclipse goes to the dog park daily.</p>
