<h2>1. Train Your Pet</h2>
<p>The first thing that you must pay attention to is training your dog.  You must train your dog to not pee inside the house, If you practice it regularly and discipline them in a certain way, they will form a habit and know what is the correct place to urinate.</p>
<h2>2. Clean Spots Quickly</h2>
<p>Do not delay or forget about cleaning the stains. Make sure that you take immediate action as soon as you notice it. The longer you wait, the harder it gets to get rid of the stain.</p>

<h2>3. Use Appropriate Chemicals for Cleaning</h2>
<p>You can clean the stains with plain water as well. But you can use a good quality detergent or floor cleaner to get rid of the stains.</p>
<h2>4. Baking Soda as a Smell Remover</h2>
<p>Pet pee does not have the best smell. It can create a bad odour, and so the best way to remove it is by using baking soda. You must have used baking soda for cleaning your makeup sponge, but you must also try this trick.</p>
<p>First, clean the floor with a detergent and then apply some baking soda to the limited area. You will notice that soon the bad odour will fade away.</p>
<h2>5. Choose Enzyme Based Product for Old Stains</h2>
<p>Enzyme based products that are used for removing old or difficult stains have given significant results.</p>

<h2>6. Use Hydrogen Peroxide Carefully</h2>
<p>Most people prefer Hydrogen Peroxide for cleaning different kinds of stains. But when cleaning a carpet or rug, you should use a small quantity. Using a large quantity can have a bleaching effect on the carpet.</p>
<h2>7. Leave Pets Outside if You Have a Yard</h2>
<p>Dogs love to be in an open space. It gives you the opportunity to have more pets with less trouble. If you have a big yard in your house, leave your pet outside unless they wish to enter inside of the house.</p>
<h2>8. Illuminate Pet Stains with Black Light</h2>
<p>The black light allows you to discover small and hidden spots that a human eye cannot identify easily.</p>
<h2>9. No Detergents with Ammonia for Cat Urine</h2>
<p>Detergents contain ammonia. Even after you wash the area where your cat has urinated, it is likely that it will do it again at the same place. The smell can motivate them to repeat the act again and again.</p>
<h2>10. Don’t Use Steam Cleaners for Urine Stains</h2>
<p>The heat produced by steam clears can be useful for other stains. But do not try it for cleaning urine stains. It can have a diverse effect on your carpet and make it worst.</p>
