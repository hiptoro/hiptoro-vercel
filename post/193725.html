			<p>Kids were picked up later than usual because the school was delayed due to bad weather. The driver had made a pit stop before his route that the parents didn&#8217;t know about.</p>

<h2>Wayne Price is a familiar face in the Montevallo community.</h2>
<p>The kindhearted man worked as a contractor for many years before closing his company to serve with the Youth Ministry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He became a beloved mentor to many of the kids after he started driving a school bus. Price has grown close enough to the kids to know how certain things will affect their day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>On the morning of December 11th, Price received a phone call saying that schools would be closed for two hours because of bad weather.</h2>
<p>Many kids in Montevallo might not get to eat because of the shortened school day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the kids at Montevallo Elementary School are low-income students who are eligible for the National School Lunch Program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Most of the kids would go hungry if the school was closed in the morning.</h2>

<p>Allison Campbell, Principal of Montevallo Elementary, told <a href="https://www.today.com/food/alabama-school-bus-drive-buys-mcdonald-s-50-kids-t145322">TODAY</a>:</p>
<p>“For a lot of students that means that they won’t get to eat.”</p>
<p>“It speaks volumes to [Price’s] character that he was attuned to that.”</p>
<p>Price came up with a plan when he realized the implications for his students. He bought himself a breakfast sandwich and others for every child on his bus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>“When I got to the McDonald’s, I asked the manager, ‘Can you turn around 50 biscuits in 15 minutes and can you give me as good of a deal as possible?&#8217;”</h2>
<p>Every student was given a free breakfast after Price walked out with a box of sandwiches. “When the kids got on I said, ‘So, what do ya want? Sausage? McMuffin?” he told <a href="https://www.today.com/food/alabama-school-bus-drive-buys-mcdonald-s-50-kids-t145322">TODAY</a> with a laugh.</p>
<p>“I just love my kids. I got a lot of fist bumps, lots of high-fives, lots of ‘Love you, Mr. Price,’ lots of ‘Thank you, Mr. Price.&#8217;”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The story was shared on the school&#8217;s Facebook page.</h2>
<p>“Mr. Price, one of our bus drivers, truly demonstrates the spirit of Christmas!” they <a href="https://www.facebook.com/montevalloelementary/photos/a.381150881987585/1510387862397209/?type=3&amp;theater">wrote</a>. “On Tuesday, when school was delayed due to icy roads, and we weren’t able to serve breakfast, he purchased biscuits from McDonald’s for his entire bus of students. What a kind act that our students will forever remember!”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mr. Price, for making a lasting impact in the lives of our students!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The residents from the community said that this act of kindness is not out of the ordinary for Price.</h2>
<p>Derek Wilson wrote: “Anyone who knows Way Price would know that this isn’t a random moment. In the almost 20 years of knowing him, I’ve seen this man give so much of himself to his community.” Sheila Brown Barrow added: “I have known Wayne and his family for many years and he did not do this for notoriety. He did it because he cares for kids.”</p>
<p>Let’s give a shoutout to Mr. Wayne Price. The world could use more kindhearted actions like his.</p>
