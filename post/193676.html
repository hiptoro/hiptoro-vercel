			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 4.5-meter (14.8-foot) saltwater female crocodile has become an icon to the people in Palu, the capital city of Central Sulawesi. The beast was seen on the city’s river with the tire around its neck becoming increasingly tighter, running the risk of choking her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A wild crocodile with a used motorcycle tire stuck around it</span><span style="font-weight: 400">s neck for six years has finally been freed by an Indonesian bird catcher named Tili. The tireless effort </span><span style="font-weight: 400">that wildlife conservation officials hailed as a milestone Wednesday.</span></p>

<p>His biggest save to date was six years in the making.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2016, residents near the Palu River spotted a crocodile with a tire around its neck, earning </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">him the name “the crocodile with a tire necklace.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-193688 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-3.png" alt="" width="901" height="504" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-3.png 901w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-3-300x168.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-3-768x430.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-3-438x246.png 438w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-3-255x144.png 255w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Local conservationists have made two failed attempts to catch the animal and remove the tire. Professional crocodile wranglers from Australia also flew to Indonesia to try to catch the elusive reptile but came up empty-handed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s when Tili stepped up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I caught the crocodile by myself,” he </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/crocodile-tyre-neck-six-years-finally-freed-indonesia-rcna15460"><span style="font-weight: 400">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. “I was asking for help from people here but they were scared.”</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-193689 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-2.png" alt="" width="901" height="502" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-2.png 901w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-2-300x167.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-2-768x428.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 901px) 100vw, 901px" /></p>
<p>During his first two attempts, the ropes he used weren’t strong enough to contain the massive creature. So on his third attempt, he went with something much stronger: Nylon ropes used for tugging boats.</p>
<p>But the ropes alone wouldn’t be enough. In order to lure the crocodile close enough for him to be captured, Tili used chicken as bait… and it worked!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-193690 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/5-1.png" alt="" width="900" height="727" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/5-1.png 900w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/5-1-300x242.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/5-1-768x620.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>At this point, Tili had caught the attention of several bystanders. But instead of just standing by and watching, dozens of them joined in on what had become a three-week-long rescue mission.</p>
<p>First, they helped drag the crocodile to shore. Once his jaws were securely shut tight with a rope, Tili used a saw to remove the tire.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-193691 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-1.png" alt="" width="904" height="721" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-1.png 904w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-1-300x239.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-1-768x613.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 904px) 100vw, 904px" /></p>
<p>After a few loving pets for the frightened croc, he was returned back to the river a much happier fellow.</p>
<p>“I did not learn this anywhere,” Tili said of his crocodile rescuing prowess. “I just can’t stand to see animals hurt.”</p>
