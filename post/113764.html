			<p>That time of the year is here when we&#8217;ll be hearing more popping sound of fireworks. As much as we enjoy them, they do cause pollution and a lot of stress for our little poochie at home. They have an anxiety attack almost and are in a lot of distress due to the sound. If you are looking for an easy and quick solution that you can make at home for calming your dog, then this post is just for you.

<h2>A student from the UK has come up with a useful hack on how to calm your dog during fireworks</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113765 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-21.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-21.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-21-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>17-year-old Caitlin Miller from South Shields, UK has shared an amazing hack for helping calm her dogs on Facebook. To your surprise, the best part about it is that It costs $0.</p>
<p>Caitlin suggested, that instead of buying expensive dog jackets or supplements, other dog owners should use a pair of old socks. “For all those whose dogs are scared of fireworks,” she wrote on Facebook, “Instead of buying anti-stress bands or anything else off of the internet, just cut the two ends off a sock and put it on their head ensuring it’s not too tight, but comfortable.”</p>
<h2>It’s absolutely cost-free and only involves using an old sock and a pair of scissors</h2>

<p>“It gives them a sensation of being cuddled and relaxes them. We used them last year, as firework season is back, we’re using them again, and thought I’d share with my friends,” Caitlin’s Facebook post continued.</p>
<p>Caitlin shared that the hack works on both of her dogs. He has a 5-month-old Jack Russell named Cookie and a 9-year-old Pomchi named Ruby.</p>
<h2>Caitlin’s hack was inspired by an anti-stress dog band she saw online, which sells for about $12</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113767 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-21.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="763" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-21.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-21-275x300.jpg 275w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>An anti-stress dog band was available online and it cost about £10 (a little bit over $12). Caitlin&#8217;s hack was inspired by this band but does not involve any buying or waste of money. You can make your stress relief band at home.<br />
His post on Facebook has over 11k comments and 1.4K likes. People just loved his idea. “Tubigrip bandage works too &amp; stretches. It’s what I use on my cocker spaniel, she cuddles into me with it on &amp; falls asleep!” someone shared a useful tip, too.</p>
<p>Someone even pointed out that this hack won&#8217;t work for a dog who has a big head.</p>
