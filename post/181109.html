			<p>At 18-years-old, Seth was homeless and living in a car, but his biggest dream was to have a family.</p>
<p>Being an orphan or surrendered child, or a child that needs to live without their biological parents is hard enough. Failure to adopt can make things worse.</p>

<h2>Most of the children who are growing up in the US foster system have a single dream. To find a real family that considers the children their own.</h2>
<p>This never happens for a lot of kids. Around 20,000 children age out of the foster system every year. They are left alone to build a life from scratch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>When Seth became an adult, he couldn&#8217;t count on the foster care system anymore.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-181114" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-224.png" alt="" width="702" height="591" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-224.png 702w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-224-300x253.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></p>
<p>When he was put up for adoption as a toddler, he spent a decade in unhappy foster homes. He realized he had no one to turn to when he became older.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He became homeless and lived in a car at the age of 18.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-181115" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-225.png" alt="" width="699" height="630" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-225.png 699w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-225-300x270.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /></p>
<p>During an interview with USA Today, he said that he was empty, alone, and nowhere to fit in. He wanted a proper family to call his own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A series of events started happening that would change his life forever.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-181116" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-226.png" alt="" width="699" height="780" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-226.png 699w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-226-269x300.png 269w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /></p>
<p>When Robert and Ara Hunt met with the boy, things began to change for him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Seth&#8217;s biological sister was already adopted by the Hunt family.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-181117" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-227.png" alt="" width="696" height="708" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-227.png 696w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-227-295x300.png 295w" sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></p>
<p>Ara Hunt said that they found forever when they let go of their fears. The couple set up things in a way so that Shyann would be able to meet her brother who they never knew existed, and the reunion was touching. It was meant to happen from then on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>After the reunion, the Hunts, who already had a large family including two daughters and a son still living at home, invited Seth to move in with them.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-181118" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-228.png" alt="" width="693" height="642" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-228.png 693w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-228-300x278.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px" /></p>
<p>The transition period was challenging, but they found their communication codes, and living all together made sense to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Hunts officially adopted Seth, one year later.</h2>
<p>A group of people who love the Hunt family gathered in a courtroom. They all became a family there.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-181119" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-229.png" alt="" width="699" height="687" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-229.png 699w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-229-300x295.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 699px) 100vw, 699px" /></p>
<p>Robert Hunt said he knew he was a part of the family when he saw the interview. &#8220;We are doing this to make it legal. He is our son,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Seth decided to change his name. He is named after the family that gave him the most precious gift of all: somewhere to belong.</h2>
<p>Logan said that it felt awesome and seems as if he was at peace.</p>
