<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meet a stray calico cat that got her own cozy condo in Police Department after she kept coming there. This cat is now known as a SWAT cat and has been visiting the police station for the past four years. </span></p>
<p>“[We] have tried numerous tactics over the years to convince her to come in from the elements but she is set in her ways,” a spokesperson from the police station wrote online.</p>
<p>“Officer Jamie Pietroski, a 15-year veteran of the Boston Police Department, stayed late after work for several nights painstakingly preparing Swat Cat’s new home,” the department reported. “The condo features a spacious studio interior layout, a large deck for outdoor dining, and glass sliding doors offering panoramic city views.”</p>
<h2><strong>An addition to the Boston Police Department’s SWAT team – a stray calico kitty.</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>One day she came and never left. The cops named her the SWAT cat.</strong></h2>
