			<p>Mistakes can happen no matter what, and anyone who has ever tried out their looks knows that. Professionals do their magic at beauty salons. We can already imagine ourselves leaving the salon and going out to conquer the world if we choose to. Our previous features about makeup and hair accidents proved that not all features are created equal.</p>
<p>Many of us have been horrified by the thought of sitting in front of a mirror and having our hair done. Sometimes, the results of beauty procedures are not what we expected, leaving us completely dissatisfied with our new look. You are in good company if this sounds familiar. This new list will cause a genuine laugh.</p>
<p>We scoured the internet for the most bizarre, cringe-worthy, and downright tragic hair and makeup moments people have shared online. Prepare for some beauty disasters of epic proportions. You can scroll through the list, upvote the pics that surprised you most, and tell us what you think of them in the comments.</p>

3. This is what happened to my client when she went to a different salon.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Picture this: You do your research, choose a salon, and book a hair or makeup appointment, but then you end up in the chair, overwhelmed with uncertainty. You blame the lighting and think it will look better once you step outside. You know that something isn&#8217;t right, and can&#8217;t help but be disappointed by the result.</p>
<p>Sounds familiar? No one is immune to these mistakes. We don&#8217;t expect beauty and hair experts to make such mistakes, whether it&#8217;s a tragic hairstyle, a color refresh, or a makeup look that makes you look like you&#8217;re from another planet. Here we are.</p>

4. $60 for professional Halloween makeup. I asked for a photo with just a little fake blood. On the right is what the makeup artist gave me.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last thing we want to do when we give our faith, hair, and face to a stranger is to cry and wish to erase it all. When you look in the mirror for the first time, you are met with someone who feels completely different from you. When it comes to makeup, you immediately notice the mistakes, too much foundation here, too little color there, and what is up with all this unnecessary contouring? Makeup that isn&#8217;t applied correctly can ruin our day. Fortunately for us, there are experts who can give us advice on how to fix these mistakes.</p>

<p>Daniel Martin, the makeup artist who works for Jessica Alba, told Vogue that people are entitled to request a redo if they are dissatisfied with the results. &#8220;As artists, we have to remember that we’re providing a service and we can’t take things too personally,&#8221; he said. They should listen to your wishes because makeup is subjective.</p>
<p>If you are one of the people who freeze in uncomfortable situations or avoid them at all costs, you should bring an image of your desired look as a reference. Before they begin, be clear with the artist about your dislikes. &#8220;Hate the way you look with mascara on your bottom lashes? Cringe at the idea of contouring? Tell the artist directly, and your honesty will only aid in the execution.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes we need to make our own decisions. &#8220;At the end of the day, it’s only makeup and it can be fixed,&#8221; Martin said and offered some sound advice to prepare you for any possible damage control in the future. First, &#8220;If you’re left with too much coverage on the skin and the finish on your face is too powdery, misting will break up the finish a bit. If you don’t have a misting spray, a wet paper towel pressed onto the skin will do the trick as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, if your artist somehow managed to make you look like a mannequin, Martin suggested, &#8220;If the foundation is looking too opaque and flat, I add a bit of radiance to the complexion by using a dry facial oil that won’t break up the powder that’s already on top of the skin. A facial oil used with a foundation brush will add the skinlike texture you want without the feeling of added weight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to eyebrows, one of the most common fears we have is to see that they are too dark for our liking. &#8220;If the brow is overly done, split tissue paper to a single sheet, place it over your brow, and buff on setting powder on top of it. This will soften the depth of the brow tone,&#8221; Martin suggested. &#8220;If your edges are too &#8216;fleek,&#8217; use a Q-tip dipped in cleansing water to soften them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rob, the owner of The Brentwood Hairdresser said that setting unrealistic expectations is one of the reasons for regrettable haircuts. They are unable to manage clients&#8217; expectations and deliver something that is much more suitable to their lifestyle and the style that they are after.</p>
