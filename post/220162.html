			<p>Johnny Depp made the dream of a young fan who was about to die come true with a surprise involving Captain Jack Sparrow.</p>
<p>When it came to the 11-year-old Kori, the actor from Pirates of the Caribbean decided to do something extra special. Over the years, he has often made fans happy by playing the famous character, but for Kori, he decided to do something extra special.</p>
<p>He was given the name Captain Kori at birth. On his YouTube channel, Kraken The Box, he is affectionately known as Captain Kori. This is because he was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which makes it hard for blood to flow normally to the heart.</p>
<p>Since 2018, he&#8217;s had two heart transplants. Unfortunately, his body rejected both of them, so he and his medical team decided that he won&#8217;t get another one.</p>
<p>This means that he is now getting palliative care, and his mother Pixi recently told a source that his condition &#8220;has no cure right now.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>He has always stated if he ever needed another transplant, it is something he would never go through again so the second they told me the news, I knew this was only ever going to go one way,</p></blockquote>
<p>she said.</p>
<blockquote><p>The first transplant wasn&#8217;t easy but it went quite well. The second one was extremely traumatic for him.</p>
<p>It was extremely painful and drawn-out and he had to learn to walk and talk [again].</p>
<p>He said he would much rather pass away than have to go through anything like that ever, ever again.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t just his decision, it was with the medical team as well, and it wasn&#8217;t taken lightly, but he has had a big part in this decision and he understands what is going to happen.</p></blockquote>

<h6></h6>
<p>The brave 11-year-old boy decided to start his own YouTube channel, and he wants to get as many subscribers as he can. His talk with Depp has already helped him get this project off to a good start.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, he was happy about having 10,000 subscribers. As of the time, this article was written, that number had jumped to 186,000.</p>
<p>In the personal video message that Depp sent to Kori, he is dressed and made up like he usually does for Captain Jack Sparrow. Reports say that the video message was put together by the charity Make A Wish.</p>
<p>He stays true to his character throughout the whole conversation by using the slurred speech patterns that are typical of him:</p>
<blockquote><p>Captain Kori&#8230; I understand you&#8217;re quite the YouYube channel man, or you shall be and all that YouTubeness.</p>
<p>So what I&#8217;m saying is I shall be glad to follow your YouTube channel and I shall tell all my friends to follow your YouTube channel.</p>
<p>And that, I think, will make for a wonderful entertainment&#8230; momentary lapse of togetherness.</p></blockquote>
<p>He added,</p>
<blockquote><p>I shall be there, watching moments with you&#8230; tubing-you YouTubing.</p>
<p>I wish you the best of luck, I&#8217;m your number one fan Captain Kori, all respect and love mate.</p></blockquote>
<p>And if that wasn&#8217;t already sweet enough, Depp FaceTimed Kori while pretending the whole time that he was on a ship. He did this while always staying in character.</p>
<p>His mother recorded the call, and the hilarious video of it was posted on his YouTube page, where it ended on a cliffhanger.</p>

<p>At the end of the video, Captain Kori says that once he has 200,000 subscribers to his channel, he will post a video of the moment Jack Sparrow knights him. Based on how things are going right now, it won&#8217;t be long before he reaches that point.</p>
<p>Thousands of people have liked what&#8217;s being said in the discussion that&#8217;s going on right now. One person wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kori&#8217;s story on YT is the reason why the Internet exists. Screw all the other fraud, attacks, drama, and bullcrap&#8230; THIS is what we should be doing as humans on Spaceship Earth!</p></blockquote>
<p>Another said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone else feel like we need more of the Adventures of Kori and Jack?&#8221; Damn straight we do.</p>
<p>JD has a heart of gold,&#8221; added a third. &#8220;Can&#8217;t help but love and respect him. Kori definitely picked the right idol. And to his Mom&#8230;you are amazing! Love and blessings to you all.</p></blockquote>
