			<p>Canadian rapper <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/bhad-bhabies-talk-at-oxford-university-has-people-greet-her-with-thunderous-applause/">Tory Lanez</a> has been found guilty by the Los Angeles jury in the <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/imagine-the-franchise-you-love-mocking-you-she-hulk-trolls-misogynistic-marvel-fans/">Megan Thee Stallion</a> shooting. Lanez can face up to 22 years and eight months in prison. Megan testified at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center in Los Angeles against Lanez on December 13, 2022. She revealed that Lanez yelled, &#8220;Dance, b***h!&#8221; before shooting her three times in the foot. She claims that the bullet fragments are still in her foot.</p>
<p>Megan&#8217;s fans have also requested the prosecution of her ex-best friend Kelsey Harriss who was present at the disturbing event. However, when she took the stand she denied any form of participation. Kelsey was granted immunity by the prosecution but she was still denied seeing Tory shoot Megan. Megan&#8217;s attorney, Alex Spiro, told the news outlet post the verdict, &#8220;The jury got it right. I am thankful there is justice for Meg.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Tory Lanez found guilty in the Megan Thee Stallion shooting</h2>
<p>District Attorney Gascón praised Megan Thee Stallion&#8217;s bravery saying, &#8220;I want to start by highlighting the bravery of Megan Pete. You showed incredible courage and vulnerability with your testimony despite repeated and grotesque attacks that you did not deserve. You faced unjust and despicable scrutiny that no woman should ever face and you have been an inspiration to others across LA County and the nation.&#8221;</p>

<p>He continued, &#8220;Women, especially Black women, are afraid to report crimes like assault and sexual violence because they are too often not believed. This trial, for the second time this month, highlighted the numerous ways that our society must do better for women. I’d also like to thank the jurors for their time and thoughtful deliberation, and our trial team for their tireless pursuit of the truth. You spent countless hours away from your families during the holiday season preparing this case and finding justice for Ms. Pete. Your sacrifice is appreciated.&#8221;</p>
