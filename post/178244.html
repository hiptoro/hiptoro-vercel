			<p>One should not be ashamed of asking for help when they are in trouble. Seems like a 82-years old grandma named Nancy have understood this thing.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why when she ran into issues getting off the plane, she accepted help from a total stranger, who actually was an NFL player.</p>
<h2>Everyone needs help, from time to time.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178264" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-39.png" alt="" width="868" height="857" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-39.png 868w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-39-300x296.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-39-768x758.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-39-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" /></p>
<p>This is the story of Nancee Lingg, age 82, who landed at Appleton International Airport after a long flight. The elderly woman was struggling to handle her heavy luggage and no one was around to help. So a tall man kindly offered to help her with her bags and she gratefully accepted.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178266" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-27.png" alt="" width="867" height="848" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-27.png 867w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-27-300x293.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-27-768x751.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 867px) 100vw, 867px" /></p>
<h2>But things didn’t get easier for the elderly woman.</h2>
<p>&#8220;Nancee and the kind stranger were told by a flight attendant that someone would be waiting for her in a wheelchair. But when they left the plane, they discovered that no one was there and all the wheelchairs were folded up.</p>
<p>This might have led to Nancee asking for help from the staff, but the kind stranger leaped into action. He asked if he could push Nancee and she said yes.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Nancee had no idea who was helping her until she and the stranger met up with her granddaughter.</h2>
<p>You can imagine the friendly conversation that passed between Nancee and her helper as they traveled through the airport. But Nancee had no idea how fortunate she was, until she met up with her granddaughter.</p>

<h2>But Teresa wasn’t the only one who noticed Aaron.</h2>
<p>As it turns out, Aaron’s act of kindness didn’t go unnoticed. Twitter user, “Momica” snapped a photo of the Packers player and shared it on social media. She said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/MonicaAllen11/status/1001298202044354561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Just watched Packers Aaron Jones push a random lady through the Appleton airport because there was no there to push her. GO PACK GO”</p></blockquote>

<p>Twitter users exploded with praise for Aaron’s actions, especially when Teresa responded to the tweet with the photos she took with Aaron and her grandmother and telling the world; “That’s my Grandma!”</p>

<h2>Then word reached the coach…</h2>
<p>Once news of the incident reached Packers coach Mike McCarthy, he responded with this <a href="https://www.packersnews.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2018/05/31/packers-aaron-jones-good-deed/661251002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’ll just say about Aaron Jones and our players: I’m thankful that everybody else is getting to see what I get to see pretty much every day. I mean, this is a tremendous locker room. We’ve been very fortunate and blessed with the caliber of character that we have in our locker room.”</p></blockquote>
