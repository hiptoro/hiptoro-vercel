			<p>What are your thoughts on classical art? There is no denying that painters from hundreds of years ago were amazing, regardless of whether you visit the Louvre on a yearly basis or your definition of classical art is the paintings on the walls of your grandmother&#8217;s house. It is incredible how many of their works withstand the test of time and continue to be adored by millions of people each year in museums all over the world. However, if you aren&#8217;t an enthusiast of classical art, you might be asking how any of these dingy, outdated paintings apply to you.</p>
<p>My introduction to the Classical Damn Instagram page is below. This account has developed a devoted following for annotating pictures of historical works of art with humorous contemporary spins. We&#8217;ve compiled a few of our favorite postings from the page below to share with you all. The page is filled with memes that make comments on everything from current societal issues to the ridiculousness of their paintings. Enjoy this list, which can give you the impression that you&#8217;re in the hippest art museum in the world, and don&#8217;t forget to vote up the images that you think are the funniest.</p>

<p>According to an interview with the page&#8217;s founder, Classical Damn was created in 2019 with the intention of fusing their two passions for art and memes. The page has gained over 340k followers over the previous few years, so they undoubtedly did a tremendous job. Although meme culture was undoubtedly not around when these paintings were made, it&#8217;s wonderful to see how modern and classical approaches have been combined. It makes sense to comment on many of these works of art using contemporary analogs of issues that are commonplace or circumstances that are relatable because they were likely just ordinary pictures intended to portray everyday life at the time they were created.</p>

<p>You could be motivated by the website to explore the world of classical art. In order to learn more about how J.T. Lanci became interested in classical art and what he finds most appealing about it, we contacted the blogger and founder of the Véronais Art Blog. “I spent a few years living in my grandfather&#8217;s home city of Lanciano, Italy. There I was exposed to classical art and learned a whole new vocabulary for talking about it,” he told. &#8220;What really made me fall in love with classical art is its universality. Classical art tells stories that speak to us as sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, spouses, and every other role life hands us as human beings. Classical art is for all of us, and it tells the stories that have defined us since the beginning of time.”</p>
<p>J.T. was also questioned about the contemporary value of classical art. “Classical art is more relevant today than ever,” he said. “In the modern world we are bombarded with messages about who we are or who we are supposed to be, and classical art grounds us in our natural form. Moreover, the beauty of classical art has stood the test of time and inspires us to share our own inner beauty with the world.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>J.T. then offered some advice to anyone who wants to learn more about classical art but is unsure of where to begin. “I would encourage anyone that is interested in learning more about classical art to take an art appreciation course. These courses are often offered by local museums or online. There are also many wonderful art analysis videos available for free on YouTube,” he suggested. “Try searching for ‘art analysis of’ and check out some of the incredible videos that pop up. Of course, there are also great resources available on my blog, <a href="https://veronais.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Véronais Art Blog</a>.”</p>

<p>J.T. wished to emphasize that anyone can appreciate classical art. “Don&#8217;t let anyone turn you away from classical art with the impression that it is snobby or pretentious. The great artists that created these works are reaching down through the centuries to speak directly to our innermost selves. Those messages are intended for you, so don&#8217;t let some condescending dork in a turtleneck gatekeep with his fancy lingo and French pronunciations.”</p>

<p>J.T. discusses on his blog how unique it was that classical art could be appreciated by everyone even when it was initially produced. A luxury or privilege shouldn&#8217;t be having access to art. “Classical art is therefore important because it is an expression of art directed at common people,” he writes. “While it is true that in many cases classical art was commissioned or endorsed by aristocrats and church officials, its messaging is downright proletarian in delivery. And despite the modern impression of classical art as a taste acquired by the upper-classes, it is only much later in art history that we find forms of expression that deliberately exclude the masses.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rembrandt may not be as well-liked by people today as memes and contemporary art, but classical art still draws large crowds. In the case of the Louvre, there were a lot of people there. A record-breaking 10.2 million people visited the Louvre in 2018 throughout the course of the whole year. In addition to breaking my own record, this was also a global record for museum attendance. The Louvre Abu Dhabi (which recently celebrated its first anniversary), the flagship exhibition &#8220;Delacroix (1798-1863),&#8221; and Beyoncé and JAY-&#8220;Apes**t&#8221; Z&#8217;s video with its homage to some of the museum&#8217;s greatest works of art are among the factors cited by the museum on its website as contributing to the increase in visitors. Even the Louvre admits that fusing modern and classical art is perfectly acceptable and can even improve modern viewers&#8217; interest in traditional works.</p>
