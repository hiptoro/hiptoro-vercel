<p>I once had a job at a dog kennel and my job was to sleep In a bedroom with a dog or two, provided a comfy bed &amp; Netflix/wifi. I was getting paid $30/hr to basically cuddle with dogs.</p>

I worked as a massage “model” at a massage school. My job was to lay there and be massaged for a few hours while the students did their lessons or took their exams. It was £30 an hour which isn’t loads, but better than the £10 an hour office job I had before.</p>

In college I had to catalogue and convert old radio shows. I was literally paid to listen to old comedy shows. The actual &#8216;work&#8217; was loading the reels and pressing a button.</p>
<p>Neat side effect is Looney Toons cartoons make more sense, I am getting more of the jokes, turns out they were just meme fests for their time.</p>

My next-door neighbor works in a power station. His job is to sit in front of a monitor and make sure everything is working well. If something goes wrong, he calls the appropriate workstation and they fix the problem. Because an alarm sounds if something is out of sync (which rarely happens) he is able to play games or read a book 99% of the time. He is on $150 per hour to basically play games and chill at work.</p>

I work at a heliport where I just get a couple of passengers&#8217; bags, put them on the heli, and then go and sit on my phone for however many hours until the heli gets back. Rinse and repeat. Roughly $70k</p>

I.T. Manager at a university. The techs know their jobs, their users, and manage their own schedules and workloads among themselves. Managers basically just have to rubber-stamp timecards, confirm parts orders, and make sure the techs don&#8217;t all take vacations at the same time.</p>

I had a job like this. I got paid $28 an hour working as an administrative assistant in a high school. It takes like 15 minutes to input grades and send truancy letters. Answering phone calls always resort to just transferring them to the Principal or school nurse. Literally, nothing to do. I left the job because there&#8217;s no work in the summer (school is closed) and honestly, the environment was toxic. When you have that much free time at work, people want to start talking about their personal lives and I don&#8217;t like to talk about mine to my toxic co workers. So I left. This job was the definition of money doesn&#8217;t buy happiness.</p>

<p>Depends on where you live, but in my neck of the woods, firefighters get paid six figures and spend most of their time chilling. Of course, when you&#8217;re called to work, you really got to work, and you don&#8217;t get to just leave work to go home when your shift is over when [hell] goes down.</p>

Call Center management. Not even something high up like operations or quality assurance, even being middle management can be lucrative. I&#8217;ve worked a few call center jobs, the people on the bottom absolutely get overworked, stressed out&#8230; but once you get to management it&#8217;s easy.</p>
<p>Last call center job I worked, I got promoted to management just due to how long I had been there. After the promotion, I was paid 50K per year to sit at home, listen to people do their job, fill out paperwork and have the occasional web meeting. I spent more time playing video games and working out than anything else while on the clock.</p>
<p>The funniest part to me is that when I gave my notice, they tried to offer me a promotion to stay because I was such a hard worker. I was super tempted to laugh and tell them how little work I actually did in a day.</p>

My current job. Project Manager for US Based Fortune 200 Company, permanent work from home, make six figures, and I do maybe 4 hours of actual work each week. I have my home office set up where I have 2 gaming monitors connected to my gaming laptop sitting on my desk directly in front of me. Then I have my work laptop sitting to one side that&#8217;s got the volume turned up so I hear if I get an email or message. When I do, I handle that, then go back to my personal laptop. Most days I&#8217;m either playing video games, watching movies, browsing Reddit, studying for new certifications, or doing stuff around the house like laundry, dishes, cleaning rooms, food prep, etc. People on my team constantly say things like &#8220;Man, this workload is insane.&#8221; I&#8217;ve got the same and even more than some. It&#8217;s so boring. But, they&#8217;re paying me to dick around most days.</p>

I have some relatives that work for the (US) Federal Government that often talk about jobs where they work in areas like Accounting and Project Management that make over $100,000 and might on a busy day have as much as two hours of actual work. My Aunt was talking about this one older women near retirement that made over $120,000 a year and her only job was running some transactions every morning, which usually took no more than 20 minutes, then she would spend the rest of the day knitting at her desk.</p>
