			<h2>What comes to your mind when someone says “Great Dane”?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, so for some people Great Dane can be a little intimidating and scary because they are so big (so freaking big). But C’mon, they are not scary. They are just a little bigger doggo who needs all your love, attention, care, time, and of course, food. How can we forget the food? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People quickly feel intimidated when they see huge dogs like Pitbulls and Great Danes. It’s because they think that big dogs=big danger. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this is totally wrong. Actually it should be something like huge dogs=huge heart and more cuddles. Because yes, your big furry friend would always be with you and can, in fact, very well protect you from dangerous things. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try and understand that the bigger size of a dog does not mean that it has temperament issues. It only shows that this big furry friend has a heart as big as the universe. To show that big dogs are still a kid from inside, we have collected 20 pictures of good bois who are just being themselves. Scroll down to see ‘em all. </span></p>
