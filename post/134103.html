			<p>It feels miserable to not have your dog. There are often incidences reported where families love their dogs. There can be many reasons because of which dogs can be separated from their families. But sometimes it just feels like a miracle when after years dogs and families reunite. There are well-wishers or kind people who make this possible. But honestly, there are no words that can explain the feeling of seeing your dogs after so many days, months and years. Here are heart touching stories shared by people about how they got reunited with their four-legged buddies. So, let&#8217;s take a lot at some of them.</p>

It was about 10:30 when we first smelled smoke from the approaching Tubbs fire that has ravaged Northern California. I ran up and down our roads on the ATV, but saw nothing. At 10:55 I could see the sky turning orange. I woke Ariel and told her to get ready to leave and went to wake Scott on the east end of the property. Stephen had already awoken from the smell of the smoke and the brightening sky. By 11:10 we could see the first of the flames across the valley. By 11:15 they were growing larger and the winds went mad. We had loaded up the dogs and cats, but Odin, our stubborn and fearless Great Pyrenees would not leave the goats. Even under the best of circumstances it is nearly impossible to separate Odin from the goats after nightfall when he takes over the close watch from his sister Tessa. I made a decision to leave him, and I doubt I could have made him come with us if I tried. We got out with our lives and what was in our pockets. Cars behind us on Mark West Springs Road were pouring flames out of the windows as they roared down the road. Later that morning when we had outrun the fires I cried, sure that I had sentenced Odie to death, along with our precious family of bottle-raised goats. Today, we were able to make it back to the smoldering wasteland of our forest. Every structure is in ruins. Trees are still burning. Yet, eight goats came running to see us and get cuddles and kisses. Dixon has a burn on his back the size of a nickel. Other than that they are perfectly fine. Odin’s fur is burned and his whiskers melted. He is limping on his right leg. And he has adopted several baby deer who huddle around him for safety and water from their trough, which is miraculously intact and full of relatively clean water. We dropped off several bails of orchard grass and gave them fresh water. Tomorrow we hope to reunite them all with his sister Tessa. I’m sure Odin believes she is perished. I can’t wait to see their faces when they see each other. Odin has lived up to his namesake. Pray for him and his charges. He is our inspiration. If he can be so fearless in this maelstrom, surely so can we.</figcaption></figure>

It had been a long two and a half weeks for my oldest two children, Carter and Natalie, thinking they would never see their puppy again. Piper was a very special gift for Carter’s 12th birthday: he had always wanted a black pug since he spent his baby years with another pug he loved very much (Oliver) who had to go live with another family while his baby brother was sick. We posted and shared and talked to neighbors, news venues, and community groups but as the days passed, our hope waned. But then, amazingly we got a message this Monday night that a dog that looked like Piper had been picked up and taken to the animal shelter. I was truly shocked. We had all resigned ourselves to the reality that she probably wouldn’t come back. Lo and behold, it was her! Seeing her little tail wag as she came out from the back of the Genesee County Animal Shelter where she had been so well taken can of, I lost it!! Carter and Natalie were out of town for a few days with their dad&#8217;s family, and so I hoped to make their reunions special. This video is no doubt the embodiment of that! It’s so amazing to see the love, and honestly, the video says more than any words I could write. My son loves his dog so much, was sick while she was gone, and tonight she’s sleeping next to him again. What a Christmas miracle for our family and thank you to everyone who helped bring Piper home.</figcaption></figure>

This would never have been possible without the help of so many people. Thank you so much for never losing hope on our dog Bella. We are forever thankful for your help. At the moment our miracle dog has a full belly of food and is currently sleeping in a warm bed where she belongs. Once again thanks to everyone that either participated in searching for Bella or simply saying a prayer for her. We love all of y’all. What an amazing god we serve!!!</figcaption></figure>

Life was great with his very own two boys and a big dog brother Thunder until his dog bro moved away with Grandma. Alex was distraught and dug out of his fenced yard likely in search of Thunder. Alex’s heartbroken family searched and searched on their own too, but the weeks turned into months, which led to years, and they heard nothing. They never forgot Alex as he remained in their hearts. Just this past Valentine’s holiday, 6 years later, a Good Samaritan in Sumter County, Florida (225+ miles away) found this little bedraggled dog and brought him to YOUR Humane Society SPCA, Sumter’s oldest and largest no-kill shelter serving their community for 38 years. The shelter’s team scanned the dog for a microchip, and suddenly this lost pup had a name – Alex – and Alex had a family! The reunion took place on Valentine’s weekend and what a reunion it was! The anxious family was concerned that their then puppy would not remember them now but Alex could not contain his sheer joy of seeing them again. They all stood hugging a giddy pup who regained his identity and his long lost family. The family cried, the shelter staff and volunteers cried, this story-writer cried, all while Alex wriggled in sheer delight. Later, Alex had more good fortune as he was also reunited with his best bud Thunder! There is nothing more touching than finding your long-lost love. YOUR Humane Society SPCA was so pleased to make another wonderful reunion happen!</figcaption></figure>

About three years ago, Roscoe, a.k.a. Runt, wandered off the farm, and didn&#8217;t come home. Somehow, he made it more than ten miles away. He ended up in a neighborhood where he hung out for a couple of years. Nice people kept him fed, he mostly stayed out of trouble. Eventually he came to the shelter. After we posted his story on Facebook something wonderful happened: his family found him! After all this time! At first, Runt wasn&#8217;t sure about it at all. He kept circling around his dad, nose up, sniffing. We were all holding our breath. And then, he knew. Runt knew it was his dad! What an unexpected but so very awesome ending!

At some point, the dog ran off, and even though the family searched everywhere for her, she was nowhere to be found. After some time searching with no luck, the heartbroken family declared Abby dead. But this wasn’t the end of this story. 10 years later, Abby showed up on a porch of a house 8 miles away from her owner’s house. She was brought to a shelter, where the dog was identified based on the information in her microchip that the Suiervelds had implanted back when she was a pup. Debra was taken by surprise when she got a call that her dog was found and called it a miracle. It’s unknown where the dog was for all these years, but it’s so amazing to know, that Abby back at her loving home.</figcaption></figure>

In 2013 I separated from the Navy and was finally able to go home and reunite with my pup. Approximately a year later Champ would inevitably escape the house. I searched everywhere for my dog, had people report his whereabouts for weeks afterward with no luck of me finding my pup. 7 years later, 07/10/2020, A local farmer found him running around on his ranch, Champ was not as friendly anymore, but the farmer still continued to try to reach out to him. After continuous feeding and care, Champ became friendly with the farmer. Approximately 10 days later, the farmer noticed Champ had a limp in his leg, so as any kind-hearted person would do, he took Champ into the vet to identify what the problem may be. I received a knock on my door from the local Animal Control unit who gave me extremely shocking news that my pup was ALIVE! I could not believe my ears, the dog that I had missed so much had actually been alive this entire time! I rushed over to the hospital to see my boy! Unfortunately, his elbow is out of place and it will take surgery to repair his arm close to 100%</figcaption></figure>
