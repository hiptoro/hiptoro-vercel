			<p>Janitor drops to his knees when his coworkers raise $7,000 for a new car for himWe all hare a good connection with our coworkers at the office. And it feels great when they think and take care of you the most. In a similar incident, coworkers raised $7000 for a car for Janitor who walked miles to come to work.</p>
<p>We know you might be amazed as we do not see such helpful people around us nowadays. But, yes this incident proves that humanity still persists somewhere in the world. 60-year-old Robert Reed is working as a school janitor at Farmington Elementary School in Germantown, Tennessee for four months. And what is more interesting is that in such a short interval, the janitor has already created a huge impact on the students and the faculty.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-92814" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/janitor1.jpg" alt="Mr. Robert Reed walks miles to come to work" width="1200" height="630" /></p>
<p>Everyone at the school agrees that Mr. Robert has added a little sunshine. But, the people around him didn&#8217;t know that he didn&#8217;t have a car and walked miles to come to work. Thus, the janitor had to take two buses and then walk about 2 miles to reach school on time. And then, he walked 2 miles again at the end of the day after the school got over. He usually doesn’t get home until 8 p.m. or later. But that hasn’t stopped him from showing up every day with a smile.</p>
<p>Robert has already made his place in the hearts of his coworkers. And thus, for a few days, they dropped him to the bus stop. But, the janitor also aims to start his own business side by side. But, this is impossible until he gets a truck to reach places on time. And then, the coworkers took their generosity and kindness for the man a step further.</p>
<h3>The janitor was shocked when the coworkers raised money to get him a new car</h3>

<p>Robert learned that the staff and parents at the elementary school put their heads, hearts, and wallets together for one incredible surprise. He was so shocked that he drops to his knees in gratitude, and it’s an amazing thing to see.</p>
<p>And this generous story has left us also awestruck. And we know you might also have cried after reading the whole story. Thus, we would recommend you also keep doing good deeds and support people around you. Also, if you have any such inspiring stories, do share them with us in the comments section below.</p>
