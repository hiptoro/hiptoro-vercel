			<p>Popular comic illustrator Dylan, the creator of the popular webcomic &#8216;The Daily Dunc&#8217; gives you a sneak peek into the life where daily object surrounding you have a will of their own. To know what his idea was behind the whole comic creation, we decided to interview the artist.</p>
<p>Dylan told Hiptoro, “One of my main goals and hopes is to just put a smile on someone’s face and help them to forget any stress or anxiety that they may be going through. Even if it’s a really bad pun or dad joke, I hope that along with any eye roll comes a smirk or a giggle. That’s all I can hope for. And it’s really fun to also incorporate some personal stories, events, and my own fears and anxieties into the content; People have left comments or written to me saying that they really can relate to certain things, which is always such a great feeling. And it’s been amazing creating some cool connections with other artists and even my followers!”</p>

<p>When we asked him who his major influence was, the artist replied, &#8220;Growing up I was a huge Disney fan. I used to pause animated movies on the VCR just so I could sit there and draw characters like Aladdin or Simba from the TV. I was also a very big follower of Garfield and Calvin &amp; Hobbes comics and would often mimic their styles in my own cartooning. If I look back at some of my old drawings (I still have them all from when I was a kid), I can see a lot of influence of Garfield and Odie,…mostly the oval-shaped eyes and the little curl that Jim Davis would draw at the armpits, or neckline. Today, I notice a lot of Calvin &amp; Hobbes influence in my comics and have even been told that they can see a resemblance in the style. Another big influence of mine was online comic artist Natalie Dee. I discovered her when I was in my early 20’s and it’s safe to say she inspired me to start my own daily comic. She cracked me up!&#8221;</p>

<p>We asked him, how long does he take to complete the full comic, &#8220;It can vary for sure but I’d say somewhere in the ballpark of 3-4 hours, depending on if it&#8217;s a single or multi-panel comic. Sometimes the image can almost repeat or there isn’t a lot of change in the character movement so those can go a little faster than if there are a lot of different scene changes or variations in the character movements/expressions. Additionally, coming up with the concept itself can take some time, and sometimes even a rework of the last panel and punchline is necessary if it doesn’t quite turn out how I had envisioned it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He further added, &#8220;Absolutely. I somehow did a brand new comic every day in 2018! That took a lot of energy. Lately, I find myself reposting old content but I have a running list of concepts that I need to revisit and get some new stuff out there! But yes, getting burnt out can happen for sure. I work a full-time job as well as other life responsibilities (as we all do) so it can sometimes be tough to find the time and motivation. A break here and there, however, can really help reset the creative engine and get things going again!&#8221;</p>
