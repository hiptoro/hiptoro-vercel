			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we talk about conspiracy theories, the U.S. is one such place that cannot be ignored. And how can it be? After all, it is a sweet home to several conspiracy theories. From Area 51, Illuminati, COVID-19 pandemic, New World Order, Freemasonry, stolen election to whatnot. Forgive us as we cannot name them because we don’t have that much time. However, you might have got a rough idea of what we are talking about here. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some people blindly believe these theories, some people have solid proof that made them believe these theories. To know what is on people’s mind, a redditor posted a question asking “What conspiracy theory do you believe to be true? What evidence led you to this conclusion?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scroll down to see what made people to believe these conspiracy theories. </span></p>

<p>Modern art exists solely for money laundering.<br />
I believe that modern/minimalistic art exists solely for money laundering. It&#8217;s just a way for rich people to move money around. There&#8217;s a reason why paintings of plain geometric shapes sell for millions of dollars, and it&#8217;s not because the buyers are really into shapes</p>

<p>Area 51 is not a place for secret government/military testing with aliens and stuff, instead Area 51 is a scapegoat while shady behind the scenes stuff is going on at another military base that the general public doesn&#8217;t know about.</p>
<p>I mean if you were really going to do something in secrecy, would you do it in the place where everyone thinks it is? Hell no! I don&#8217;t have any specific evidence to back this up but it makes sense right?</p>

<p>Banks and landowners conspire to manipulate urban land prices. Turn an area into a ghetto by marking it as a high-risk loan proposition, denying loans in the area. Property values plummet on a down-town area because no one can sell, because no one can get a loan. Once things are down enough, you can buy up prime location land at pennies on the dollar then re-develop it into being worth the &#8216;real&#8217; market value of such a central location, plus what you invested in the actual development.</p>

<p>I believe the US military went to Afghanistan in order to seize control of the Poppy fields and instead of destroying them they manufactured black tar and other forms of heroin and sent it back to the states. I have several friends that were marines in Afghanistan and they&#8217;ve confirmed these suspicions. The drugs got worse after being in Afghanistan not better or more contained. The USA military is the biggest cartel in the world</p>

<p>Priceless artwork and historical documents are replicas.<br />
I’ve always speculated that a lot of priceless artwork and historical documents are actually replicas or copies.</p>
<p>Obviously a painting by a world-famous artist using a very specific technique would be very hard to fake, and I don’t think that every art scholar in the world is paid off in some grand conspiracy. Rather, I just think that either the national treasures never left their vaults or that some national treasures actually were lost to history but they were copied.</p>

<p>UFO sightings are just humans from the future on a time-traveling safari.<br />
All the UFO sightings throughout history are just humans from the future on a time-traveling safari meant to observe how we were in the past. They are supposed to keep out of sight, but thanks to human/mechanical errors, there have been hiccups with their cloaking which have resulted in being seen. That&#8217;s why there have always been so many reports of them throughout history, but there has never been an attack. It&#8217;s just us.</p>
<p>Also the reason why we don&#8217;t see as many examples of UFOs now even though pretty much everyone has a camera is because people are not that interested in this time period since we already document aspects of human life all the time.</p>

<p>When Ted Kaczynski (the unabomber) was at Harvard, he participated in a brutal psychological experiment led by professor Henry Murray. The experiment lasted for three years and by many accounts they seemed to have an extreme impact on Kaczynski’s psyche. I think this experiment was part of the CIA’s MKUltra project and destabilized Kaczynski enough to where he eventually went on his reign of terror of sending bombed packages around the country.</p>
<p>During the MKUltra project, the CIA collaborated with university professors on these mind-control experiments but a lot of the documentation was destroyed when people started to look into it.</p>
<p>TL;DR: The unabomber participated in an experiment that was a part of the MKULtra project that eventually led to him becoming a mass-murderer.</p>

<p>I believe in the mattress store conspiracy, so the conspiracy is that mattress stores are for money laundering. I went onto google maps and typed in ‘mattress stores near me’.

<p>Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 wasn&#8217;t an accident. There were definitely external forces that catalyzed its disappearance. The flight path was diverted many times and there was a lot of shady stuff about some of the passengers and the pilot of Flight 370. We may never know unless the plane is found.</p>

<p>Tinder gives fake &#8216;You got a new match!&#8217; notifications to get you to swipe more.<br />
I have a theory that Tinder gives fake &#8216;You got a new match!&#8217; notifications so people get excited and open Tinder, which leads them to swipe more.</p>

<p>Michael Jordan&#8217;s father was murdered in retribution for Jordan not paying off massive gambling debt. Jordan didn&#8217;t retire and then come back, he was suspended for gambling. In the mid 90&#8217;s, Michael Jordan was an industry. The truth about his gambling habits may have cost a lot of people a lot of money, so the cover story was presented.</p>

<p>Restaurant owners sing &#8216;Happy Birthday&#8217; to embarrass you.<br />
Restaurant owners know how awkward it is to be sung to in front of the whole establishment, and they do it to discourage people from taking advantage of their free birthday food.</p>

<p>Gas station owners are the ones putting the card scammers on the pumps. They don&#8217;t want your info, they want you to distrust pay at the pump so you&#8217;ll come inside and make an impulse buy. Most stations barely make any money of gas, the money is in the stuff they sell inside.</p>

<p>The bacon industry is ever so slightly making normal sliced bacon thinner every few years. So that eventually what was once considered normal sliced bacon becomes thick cut. Thus, saving the big bacon industry money.</p>
<p>My only evidence is the fact that my bacon, which I have always and will only buy from a specific brand, seems to be getting thinner and thinner, more flimsy, more likely to fall apart as I get it out of the package.</p>
