			<h2><strong>Cats choose us not the other way around.</strong></h2>
<p>When you go to adopt a pet, you think it&#8217;s you who is choosing the pet. But when you read this story, you will change your perspective. Well, it is right to say that a pet chooses you. In this story, the guy decided in his heart that he wanted a Siamese cat. However, that didn&#8217;t happen as, by the time he went to pick the kitten, it was already taken by someone else.</p>
<p>After this, the couple saw a blind kitten named Merlin. At first, they were scared to take proper care of the kitten, but later their heart couldn&#8217;t resist posting her and taking her home.</p>
<p>&#8220;It actually was my coworker that convinced me to go in–she had just adopted a cute kitten from there. Browsing through their cat adoption site, Nathanial and I had our hearts set on a Siamese kitten, but by the time I got off work, they were all either on hold or already adopted. The lady who had shown us around eventually noticed us indecisively meandering; she stopped to tell us that she had a favorite, but that he had some issues and was sick.</p>
<p>She took us to the medical wing to show us this tiny kitten who was recovering from a head cold. When I was first told that he was blind, I was a bit worried. As a full-time student also working two jobs, I was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to provide Merlin with the attention he needed. As soon as I got to hold him, I think it was pretty obvious that he was perfect.&#8221; -Nathanial</p>
<h2>Meet Merlin, a blind kitty who has taken the Internet by storm.</h2>

<blockquote><p>He’s an affectionate cat that loves being acknowledged and held. He’s never destructive or petty, either. Because he was born blind, he really has no concept of fear, and so he’ll attempt to jump off of pretty high places. He doesn’t hide or avoid people–he’ll run up to the door to meet us and climb all over guests sitting on the couch. His preferred place is on someone’s lap. -Nathanial</p></blockquote>
<h2>Apparently, his blindness doesn’t stop him from having fun.</h2>

<h2>And he especially loves sitting on laps.</h2>

<blockquote><p>Anytime we sit on the couch or the bed, he jumps up and is ready to be cuddled. He loves having his face and ears scratched; we aren’t quite sure why, but he loves having the areas around his eyes massaged. If someone puts their hands up to his eyes or nose, he’ll usually awkwardly press into it as if he’s trying to push them away, but it’s his way of feeling loved. -Elliot</p></blockquote>
<h2>He is also a relatively new breed.</h2>

<blockquote><p>For a while, he was having seizures, and we really couldn’t figure out why. Through some research and trying out alternatives, we learned that his food was causing it. We removed wheat from his diet, and he’s been perfectly content since then. -Elliot</p></blockquote>
