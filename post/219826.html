			<p>The house that Betty White sold for $10.678 million was torn down just a few months after it was sold.</p>
<p>After the actor died on New Year&#8217;s Eve at the age of 99, the California home went on the market earlier this year.</p>
<p>The house was built in the early 1950s and had five bedrooms, six bathrooms, a pool, and a separate building for guests.</p>
<p>White moved in with her third husband, Allen Ludden, in 1968 because it was close to several studios where she worked but also gave her some privacy.</p>
<p>But the house has been torn down now, just a few months after it was sold for about $3 million more than the asking price.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is such a busy time of year and coming up on the anniversary of Betty’s passing is hitting in ways I hadn’t anticipated.</p>

<p>It will soon be one year since White passed away.</p>
<p>Agent and close friend Jeff Witjas told a source that the much-loved actor had died. On December 31, 2021, at 9.30 a.m. local time, the Los Angeles Police Department was called to a death scene. On January 17, White would have been 100 years old.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even though Betty was about to be 100, I thought she would live forever.</p></blockquote>
<p>Witjas said.</p>
<blockquote><p>I will miss her terribly and so will the animal world that she loved so much.</p>
<p>I don’t think Betty ever feared passing because she always wanted to be with her most beloved husband Allen Ludden. She believed she would be with him again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Celebrities and fans from all over the world took to social media to pay tribute to the pioneering comedian. President Joe Biden tweeted that White &#8220;brought a smile to the lips of generations of Americans&#8221; and told reporters,</p>
<blockquote><p>Who didn&#8217;t love Betty White?</p></blockquote>
