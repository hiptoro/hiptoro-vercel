			<p>If you have been on the internet long enough, you will know that cats are king.</p>
<p>There is an amazing example of how strong the feline influence can be when it comes to pet-owner relations if you are not in either of the above-mentioned categories.</p>
<p>A now open letter has been circling around online regarding two ladies who have acquired a blender, three cats who have taken it along with all of its brand-new contents, and the conflict that ensued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What would be the most powerful object on the planet? That&#8217;s right, a cat, of course!</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187128" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-61d6ced550caf__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="392" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the new year, a woman named Jessica Gerson-Neeves took to Facebook, specifically the Vitamix Canada Facebook page, where she posted an open letter to Vitamix about her odd request. Mind you, in great detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The woman shared that she asked the blender brand to help them out.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187131" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vitamix-cats-box-61d6e91e67373__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="610" /> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187130" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vitamix-cats-box-61d6cfbc3606d__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="461" /> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187129" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vitamix-cats-box-61d6cfe4f30e8__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="428" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She and her partner bought a Vitamix. It has been two and a half weeks since they did so, and they were unable to use it at all. Not even open it. Their cats Max, George, and Lando Calrissian have taken over.</p>
<p>As soon as they put the box down on the kitchen floor, they introduced themselves and began playing with it. “And that was the beginning of the end,” said Jessica in her Facebook post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It is not to have the cats blended, but to get the sturdy boxes that they use as packaging.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187135" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vitamix-cats-box-61d6cffeadd73__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="102" /> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187134" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vitamix-cats-box-61d6d026c3d26__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="680" /> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187133" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vitamix-cats-box-61d6d052aa6c5__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="363" /> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187132" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vitamix-cats-box-61d6d07a70b64__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="399" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The box has been occupied by at least one cat for weeks. They can&#8217;t shoo the cats. There were pictures and updates of the struggle on the Facebook group <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/133018060894811/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">THIS CAT IS C H O N K Y</a>, where it gained quite a following. The whole deal was called: The Great Vitamix Incident of 2021.</p>
<p>The couple got in touch with Vitamix. They admitted that requesting a whole new unit would be ridiculous and they went for a simpler solution by asking for empty blender boxes, the same ones that have the appeal and sturdiness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187138" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vitamix-cats-box-61d6d0bc40f0d__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="612" /> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187137" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vitamix-cats-box-61d6d0e591c91__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="465" /> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187136" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vitamix-cats-box-61d6d11970773__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="517" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They were apologetic, even ashamed, and called their request desperate. As they heard their plea and responded, they were reassured that they did the right thing and promised to get them some boxes so they could enjoy their blender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The long open letter was accompanied by some of the best box updates ever.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187142" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vitamix-cats-box-61d6ef0e1e9bb__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="277" /> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187141" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vitamix-cats-box-61d6db19dae44__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="949" /> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187140" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vitamix-cats-box-61d6ecab3a2ec__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="404" /> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187139" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vitamix-cats-box-61d6dbb00d9f9__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="953" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exchange gained over 11,000 likes and nearly 4,000 shares on this post alone. There were a lot of likes on each of the different posts that Jessica made in the Facebook group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People loved it all, not only because it was hilarious and adorable, but also because of a happy ending with Vitamix promising to help with the cat box issue in the couple&#8217;s household.</p>

<h2>They were promised that they would get those boxes so that they could enjoy their blender after a while.</h2>
