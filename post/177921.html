			<p>It&#8217;s hard to ignore the fact that artists seem to be in a different world from ours, but many will do a lot to show them that they haven&#8217;t started doing it yet.</p>
<p>Some tell us about their old habit of dying hard, others say they are the same person they started with, no matter how different they were.</p>
<p>But if there&#8217;s one connected feeling that our favorite stars really tell us, it&#8217;s them too, once dreamed of as children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>On November 22, ITV aired a special concert of the stars that Adele performed in earlier this month.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-177923" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-181.png" alt="" width="634" height="951" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-181.png 634w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screenshot-181-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /></p>
<p>According to People, the event&#8217;s name was Guest with Adele and one of the stars in attendance was Emma Thompson. Emma Thompson asked the singer if anyone had inspired her since she was a child.</p>
<p>She told that she had had a teacher named McDonald, who developed her interest in English and literature and also conducted dances in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>As Adele said, &#8220;She&#8217;s beautiful. She cares about us and taught us how to care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>However, the two are lost contact after leaving school when the singer was 12 years old.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-177924" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ErcJQgweLXtUtWhZ2uXF.png" alt="" width="1280" height="1907" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ErcJQgweLXtUtWhZ2uXF.png 1280w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ErcJQgweLXtUtWhZ2uXF-201x300.png 201w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ErcJQgweLXtUtWhZ2uXF-687x1024.png 687w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ErcJQgweLXtUtWhZ2uXF-768x1144.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ErcJQgweLXtUtWhZ2uXF-1031x1536.png 1031w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>But what Adele quickly saw was the fact that the professor didn&#8217;t stop thinking about her as Thompson revealed that she was in the audience that night.</p>
<p>As you can see, Adele was overcome with emotion as soon as she learned that she could meet her favorite teacher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>She couldn&#8217;t stop crying when her teacher joined her on the stage.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-177925" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/KSGaNsgyLFaMb1EC5IrD.png" alt="" width="1600" height="1507" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/KSGaNsgyLFaMb1EC5IrD.png 1600w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/KSGaNsgyLFaMb1EC5IrD-300x283.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/KSGaNsgyLFaMb1EC5IrD-1024x964.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/KSGaNsgyLFaMb1EC5IrD-768x723.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/KSGaNsgyLFaMb1EC5IrD-1536x1447.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p>After McDonald told Adele how proud she was of her, she revealed that this was all planned for her. Adele said she was a little too young since they last saw her.</p>
<p>Adele gave her a second hug as she started pulling again, and McDonald&#8217;s said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t cry, thank you. Thank you for remembering me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>But, as Adele admits, the singer will have a hard time forgetting McDonald because she believes she has changed her life.</h2>

<p>And although it seems like there is a lot to say later, Adele told her that she has the books with her.</p>
<p>Their reunion and that Adele took the time to put on makeup while crying can be seen here.</p>
