			<p>You always have the option of throwing away the leftover of a fruit or vegetable. But if you have a hidden farmer inside you who always wanted to grow his/her own vegetables and fruits at home, you can use these ideas to regrow them at home. Below are some instructions that you can follow for growing your own organic vegetables and fruits at home.</p>

There’s also another method to grow regular potatoes or sweet potatoes. Instead of placing them in the soil, you’ll have much greater success if you cut them in half and use toothpicks to suspend them over a glass of water. The great thing about sweet potatoes is that they are an excellent staple food and lost a lot longer than normal ones. This is one of the healthiest vegetables you can grow and just a few will produce hundreds. Once they start to grow roots, you can put them in soil.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="post7" class="open-list-header">#8 Sprout An Avocado Tree From The Pit</h2>
<figure id="attachment_162216" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162216" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-162216 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/8-113.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="640" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/8-113.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/8-113-300x274.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-162216" class="wp-caption-text">STEP 1 – REMOVE &amp; CLEAN PIT You’ll need to start by removing the pit from the avocado carefully (without cutting it), and then washing it clean of all the avocado fruit (often it helps to soak the pit in some water for a few minutes and then scrub all the remaining fruit off). Be careful not to remove the brown skin on the pit – that is the seed cover. STEP 2 – LOCATE WHICH END IS ‘UP’ AND WHICH IS ‘DOWN’ Some avocado pits are slightly oblong, whereas others are shaped almost like perfect spheres – but all avocado pits have a ‘bottom’ (from where the roots will grow), and a ‘top’ (from which the sprout will grow). The slightly pointier end is the top, and the flat end is the bottom. In order to get your pit to sprout, you will need to place the bottom root end in water, so it’s very important to figure out which end is the ‘top’ and which is the ‘bottom’ before you go piercing it with toothpicks. STEP 3 – PIERCE WITH FOUR TOOTHPICKS Take four toothpicks and stick them at a slight downward angle into the avocado seed, spaced evenly around the circumference of the avocado. These toothpicks are your avocado scaffolding, which will allow you to rest the bottom half of the avocado in water, so therefore the toothpicks need to be wedged in there firmly. I recommend sticking them in at a slight angle (pointing down), so that more of your avocado base rests in the water when you set this over a glass. STEP 4 – PLACE AVOCADO SEED HALF SUBMERGED IN A GLASS OF WATER And set on a quiet windowsill with sunlight. It’s helpful to use a clear glass so you can easily see when roots start to grow, and also when the water needs to be changed. Many guides recommend to change the water every day, but I found, through trial and error, that it is better to change the water every five days to a week or so. You do want to make sure you change the water regularly, to prevent mold, bacteria and fungus growth, which can doom your little avocado sprout. STEP 5 – WAIT FOR YOUR AVOCADO SEED TO SPROUT! Many online guides I have read say that sprouting can take anywhere from 2-4 weeks, but in my experience, it usually takes at least 8 weeks to get a sprout, so be patient. Here is the process you will witness: 1. The top of the avocado pit will dry out and form a crack, and the outer brown seed skin will slough off. 2. The crack will extend all the way to the bottom of the avocado pit, and through the crack at the bottom, a tiny taproot will begin to emerge. 3. The taproot will grow longer and longer (and may branch), and eventually a small sprout will peek through the top of the avocado pit. 4. Do not allow your taproot to dry out unsubmerged EVER – doing so will be the death of your plant STEP 6 – POT IN SOIL WHEN TREE IS ABOUT 6” TALL When the stem is 6-7 inches long, cut it back to about 3 inches, this will encourage new growth. When it hits 6-7 inches again, pot it up in a rich humus soil in an 8-10″ diameter pot, leaving the top half of the seed exposed. Place on a sunny windowsill. Avocados love sun – the more sun the better. STEP 7 – WATER &amp; WATCH IT GROW Give it frequent waterings with an occasional deep soak. The soil should always be moist, but not saturated. Yellowing leaves are a sign ofover-watering; let the plant dry out for a few days. STEP 8 – PINCH OUT TOP LEAVES TO ENCOURAGE BUSHINESS When the stem reaches 12 inches tall, pinch out the top two sets of leaves. This will encourage the plant to grow side shoots and more leaves, making it bushy. Each time the plant grows another 6 inches pinch out the 2 newest sets of leaves on top. STEP 9 – TROUBLESHOOTING BUGS My avocado trees seem to collect aphids – the nasty critters can’t get enough of the delicious avocado leaves. If you get them, here’s how to get rid of them: Wash all of the aphids off the plant by spraying your plant down with a hose outside or in the sink/shower. Once the little pests are off, spray your plant with a mixture of water with a small squirt of dishwashing liquid and a teaspoon of neem oil. This will keep aphids from returning. Check your plant every 4-5 days and re-clean and spray when necessary. STEP 10 – WINTERING Baby avocado trees can kick it outdoors in summer, but if you live anywhere where it gets cooler than 45 degrees F, you’ll need to bring them back indoors in the fall/winter, before the temperatures fall.</figcaption></figure>

Then remove some of the lowest leaves. Trim off the outer portion of the pineapple top at the bottom of the crown, or stem, until you see root buds. These should resemble small, brown-colored bumps around the stem’s perimeter. Allow the pineapple top to dry for several days to one week prior to planting. This helps the top to heal, discouraging problems with rotting. Although it’s possible to sprout a pineapple in water, most people have better luck rooting them in soil. Use a light soil mix with perlite and sand. Place the pineapple top in the soil up to the base of its leaves. Water thoroughly and place it in bright, indirect light. Keep it moist until roots develop. It should take about two months (6-8 weeks) for roots to establish. You can check for rooting by gently pulling the top to see the roots. Once significant root growth has occurred, you can start giving the plant additional light.</figcaption></figure>

You’ll most likely need a pot of soil for this one. Cut off a leaf or stem from a big plant and place it in a cup of water and let it grow for a few weeks. After that, transplant it to soil, keeping the soil moist but not drenched. Wait a few months and you’ll have a fully-grown rosemary plant. This one doesn’t do too well in the winter, so try and save it as a summer project.</figcaption></figure>

Allow the seeds to get a few inches high before transplanting them outdoors. During cold weather you can grow your tomatoes indoors. Just remember to keep them in an area that gets plenty of sunlight and water a few times each week.</figcaption></figure>

Select a Healthy Root. The best roots (rhizomes) for growing are firm, fleshy and already have green points forming at the end of the &#8216;fingers.&#8217; If you prefer, cut the ginger into separate pieces with at least one green tip per segment and allow to dry for a few days. 2. Soak the Roots Overnight in warm water. This will stimulate growth and rinse off any chemicals that might be present. A few of my friends have also had a lot of success soaking their various root crops in compost tea, believe it or not! 3. Set the Roots in Sphagnum Moss (or coconut fiber) so that the top of the root is visible, with the green growing tips pointing up. I used a propagating tray, but you can use any container wide enough to accommodate the root. Keep the sphagnum moss lightly moist, but allow it to dry out between waterings. 4. Transplant to a Pot once the first leaves have formed. At this point you should notice a mass of fleshy white roots, which can be gently teased loose from the moss. Hold the root just beneath the edge of the pot, and fill the pot with fresh potting mix so that the fine roots are surrounded and the top of the rhizome is barely visible. 5. Caring for Your Ginger is easy, as long as you provide warmth, humidity, moisture and drainage. Summer is the best time to grow ginger because it&#8217;s already hot and humid, but if you&#8217;re growing it indoors you can place it in a bright windowsill and occasionally mist it with water. Drainage is provided by simply using a pot with drainage holes.</figcaption></figure>

You can either chop off the bean part of the sprout or buy just the beans at your local grocery store. Soak them in a cup of water completely, mixing them around with your hand. Leave them soaked for 24 hours and the seed should start to germinate. After that, cover them in 2 paper towels, one on the bottom and one on top. Wait a few weeks and they should grow tall like grass!</figcaption></figure>

Take a radish, cut it in half, and cut off some of the green leaves on the top, but make sure to leave at least a small portion. Place the top half dangling over water by using toothpicks to suspend it in air over the glass. Just make sure that it’s not completely submerged. In a few weeks you’ll notice that roots are starting to grow out from the bottom. From there you can transplant it to a pot of soil if desired. It’s a really easy process. If it doesn’t work, try using the bottom half instead.</figcaption></figure>

All 3 plants start out growing roots along with green leaves sprouting out from the top. Cut off the end with the stem and wait for roots to grow. Once this happens after a couple of weeks, transplant the turnip to a pot of soil and wait about 3 months for the plant to fully mature. Just like beets and rutabagas, turnips do a lot better in harsher weather conditions than most other vegetables.</figcaption></figure>
