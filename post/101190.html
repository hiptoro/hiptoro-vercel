			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pet obesity is a serious thing and it can cause great harm to the animals if not given proper care to them. You will be surprised to know that nearly 55% of the home-breed dogs are overweight and it is a matter of concern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you think that your doggo is just a little chubbier and fluffier than other similar dog breeds, you cannot be more wrong. Being a responsible pet parent, it is your duty to help your furry friend lose the extra weight that is taking him one step closer to deadly health problems. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not give up on your pet because with a little patience and help from veterinarians you can bring your doggo back in shape. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Ernie who is the founder of the Association for the Prevention of Obesity in Pets says that “Obese dogs are at greater risk of developing arthritis, hypertension, diabetes, and cancer, as well as living an average of 2.5 years less than a healthy weight dog.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scroll down to see the pictures of the most amazing transformation of precious doggos who have lost a tremendous amount of weight and get inspiration.</span></p>
