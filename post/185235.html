			<p>It&#8217;s 2022 and nowadays, people can get famous by doing anything. For example, a woman has become popular by selling her farts. This is not it. In fact, she made €44,000 a week just by selling her farts.</p>
<p>Recently, she has announced her retirement, after she was rushed to the hospital for squeezing out one too many.</p>

<p>Steph Matto, 31, from Connecticut, recently found herself in A&amp;E with symptoms of a &#8216;heart attack&#8217; after experiencing shooting pains in her chest.</p>
<p>Concerned doctors performed blood tests and an electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG) but later told the 90 Day Fiancé TV star that the symptoms were actually caused by excess gas from her frequent diet of beans, eggs, and banana protein shakes.</p>
<p>Speaking about the moment she took ill, Steph said: &#8220;I thought I was having a stroke and that these were my final moments. I was overdoing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She began selling her farts in a jar in November last year, after receiving requests on the adult-content site Unfiltrd.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185245" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-26.jpg" alt="" width="848" height="1060" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-26.jpg 848w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-26-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-26-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-26-768x960.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /></p>
<p>To keep up with demand – which saw her squeeze out up to 50 jars worth of farts a week – the self-proclaimed &#8216;fartrepreneur&#8217; opted for a fiber-high diet, living off beans and eggs.</p>
<p>She later added protein shakes to the mix after discovering it made the farts smell worse.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185246" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-25.jpg" alt="" width="848" height="814" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-25.jpg 848w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-25-300x288.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/3-25-768x737.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /></p>
<p>Reliving the lead-up to the hospital visit, Steph said: &#8220;I remember within one day I had about three protein shakes and a huge bowl of black bean soup.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could tell that something was not right that evening when I was lying in bed and I could feel a pressure in my stomach moving upward.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185247" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-24.jpg" alt="" width="848" height="813" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-24.jpg 848w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-24-300x288.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-24-768x736.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;It was quite hard to breathe and every time I tried to breathe in I&#8217;d feel a pinching sensation around my heart. And that, of course, made my anxiety escalate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I actually called my friend and asked if they could come over to drive me to the hospital because I thought I was experiencing a heart attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ended up going to the hospital that evening. I didn&#8217;t tell my doctors about the farting in the jar but I did tell them about my diet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was made clear that what I was experiencing wasn&#8217;t a stroke or heart attack but very intense gas pains.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was advised to change my diet and to take a gas suppressant medication, which has effectively ended my business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steph said: &#8220;I decided to do it on a whim after people requested it a few times. As luck would have it, once I put the jars up for sale they began to sell like hotcakes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I honestly could not believe the demand. I think a lot of people have this fetish in secret.</p>
<p>&#8220;I began this venture by eating mostly protein muffins, shakes, and also hard-boiled eggs. Since then I&#8217;ve decided to branch out a little bit and try some new recipes to keep it exciting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been loving black bean salad, onion, ham, and pepper omelets, and I have been making a really great protein smoothie with lots of banana.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that certain foods produce better smelling farts, so I usually tend to go with the smoothies as opposed to things such as cabbage and eggs.</p>

<p>Steph said: &#8220;I have a lot of people praising me, calling me a girl boss, telling me that I inspire them to be unashamed of who they are and what they do.</p>
<p>&#8220;But on the other end, I have been getting a ton of negativity. I have even received death threats, people telling me I should end my life, and so on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I try my best to not react to these people and give them what they want, which is attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this day and age, we need to stop tearing people down for their choices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Especially if their choices are literally hurting no one.&#8221;</p>
