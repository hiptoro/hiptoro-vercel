			<p>The internet has it out for Kim Kardashian after her recent controversial and inflammatory comment <a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/features/kardashians-hulu-kris-kim-khloe-1235198939/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in an interview with Variety</a>: “I have the best advice for women in business: Get your [effing] ass up and work. It seems like nobody wants to work these days.”</p>
<p>The shock was tremendous, dear readers. Certain individuals were dismayed by Kim&#8217;s remarks and thought that they are fanciful, deigning, annoying, and withdrawn from the real world. In the interim, others could hardly imagine how they were hearing exhortation from a conceived lady into wealth. By the day&#8217;s end, ladies are really buckling down and they didn&#8217;t take excessively merciful to being peered down on by Kim. Notwithstanding, a few people share the assessment that Kim accomplishes truth be told buckle down, however that difficult work doesn&#8217;t constantly prompt achievement.</p>
<p>You can see how the internet reacted to Kim&#8217;s comment by scrolling down.</p>
<p>Mike Sington, Hollywood&#8217;s Ultimate Insider, shared his thoughts about Kim&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Kim’s comments were way out of line. She came from a family of wealth and privilege, which gave her an advantage the vast majority of women don’t have. The Kardashian interview with Variety was fascinating, because it really got inside the business of being a Kardashian, and it didn’t seem like anything was being held back,&#8221; he told.</p>

<p>We were told by a celebrity expert that the Kardashian brand is all about drama. &#8220;All of it is amplified for the media to create more interest in the family, which feeds the machine. It’s a never-ending cycle,&#8221; he explained that it&#8217;s a self-sustaining process where the more attention the Kardashians get, well, the more attention they end up with in the future.</p>
<p>Mike told us that the interest in the family has lasted as long as it has. &#8220;I give them a lot of credit for maintaining that interest over so many years and parlaying it into a massively successful business,&#8221; he said that credit has to be given where it&#8217;s due.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;The audience definitely has a love/hate relationship with them. We love gawking over their wealthy and lavish lifestyles. But when we do, we see all the drama and seemingly how messed up they are, which makes us realize how good we actually have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kim believes that she is telling the truth. “With all respect, and with love, I’m not, like, being a b****,” she told Variety.</p>
<p>Her response to the criticism that she and her family have gotten over the years that they are famous is, &#8220;Who gives a f**k&#8221;.</p>
<p>“We focus on the positive. We work our asses off. If that’s what you think, then sorry. We just don’t have the energy for that and we don’t have to sing or dance or act; we get to live our lives—and hey, we made it. I don’t know what to tell you,” she said.</p>

<p>The criticism of Kim came from all parts of the net. From your average social media users and well-known figures to businesswomen and people who used to work for the Kardashians. The general consensus was that the comment was tone-deaf.</p>
<p>Kim was suggesting that the type of wealth and success that she has can be reached if only you work hard enough. If you aren&#8217;t successful yet, you might not be working hard enough. That kind of thinking is limited. It ignores the impact that being born into a wealthy family has on a person.</p>

<p>It is demotivating to hear that nobody wants to work if you are barely able to make ends meet, working multiple jobs, and taking care of your family. It is the type of comment that will go down in internet history as proof that some celebrities are out of touch. Not just with their fans, but with real-life as a whole.</p>

<p>There is more to the puzzle than working hard. Sam Dogen, the founder of Financial Samurai, told that people who brag about their work hours and how difficult they are usually look for validation.</p>
<p>“Working long after your colleagues are gone means nobody will see your hard work. Hence, you need to tell people about it because the results often take time to manifest. The irony is, if you have great results, there’s no need to tell anybody how hard you work,” Sam said.</p>

<p>The expert said that the world is very competitive. It isn&#8217;t enough to work hard to get ahead.</p>
