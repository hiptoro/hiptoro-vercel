			<p>Tom Holland, who plays Spider-Man, will keep showing up in movies that are part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has been said that Holland signed a new contract with Sony Pictures to keep playing Peter Parker in more Spider-Man sequels. Sony Pictures worked with Disney and Marvel Studios, led by Kevin Feige, to add &#8220;Wall-Crawler&#8221; to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). On the podcast, The Hot Mic with Jeff Sneider and John Rocha, an insider named Jeff Sneider said that Holland had &#8220;closed a deal&#8221; for Spider-Man 4, which is the sequel to Spider-Man: No Way Home, which came out a year ago. Sneider said that Holland&#8217;s new contract includes at least three more appearances and a new Spider-Man trilogy, but this has not been confirmed. It&#8217;s not clear if this is about the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) or Sony&#8217;s Spider-Man Universe (SMU).</p>
<p>Amy Pascal, the producer of the Spider-Man movies, said last year that Sony was planning &#8220;the next three&#8221; movies with Marvel under the direction of Holland and Feige, which seemed to confirm that the studios had made another deal.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>&#8220;This is not the last movie that we are going to make with Marvel — [this is not] the last Spider-Man movie,&#8221; Pascal told Fandango while promoting No Way Home. &#8220;We are getting ready to make the next Spider-Man movie with <a href="https://comicbook.com/category/tom-holland/">Tom Holland</a> and Marvel. We&#8217;re thinking of this as three films, and now we&#8217;re going to go onto the next three. This is not the last of our MCU movies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Insiders at Sony have said that there are &#8220;no official plans&#8221; to make Spider-Man 4 or a second trilogy, so these claims are false. But Feige said that the two studios had already started making plans for the sequel to &#8220;No Way Home&#8221; just a few days after the record-breaking opening weekend of the last movie in their trilogy in December. In the month of December, this happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amy and I and Disney and Sony are talking about — yes, we&#8217;re actively beginning to develop where the story heads next, which I only say outright because I don&#8217;t want fans to go through any separation trauma like what happened after Far From Home,&#8221; Feige told <a href="https://comicbook.com/movies/news/spider-man-no-way-home-sequel-marvel-studios-kevin-feige-sony-actively-developing-spiderman-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>. &#8220;That will not be occurring this time.&#8221;</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>Sony and Disney signed a deal for five movies in 2015. This made it possible for Spider-Man to show up in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Under the terms of the deal, Holland would wear the Spider-Man costume for the first time in Captain America: Civil War in 2016, and then again in Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2017. Sony would make the film with Kevin Feige and Marvel Studios. Spider-Man was in the Marvel movies Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019), but the deal to do crossovers ended when Spider-Man: Far From Home came out.</p>
<p>Because Sony and Disney couldn&#8217;t agree on how to pay for a third Spider-Man movie together, it looked like the character would have to be taken out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the end, the two film studios were able to renegotiate and extend their previous deal, which included Spider-Man: No Way Home and an extra film for Marvel.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s reciprocal. We lend one, then they lend one, and that&#8217;s how Benedict [Cumberbatch] is in [No Way Home], so we have one more lend back that is committed,&#8221; Tom Rothman, Chairman, and CEO of Sony Pictures told <a href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/sony-pictures-ceo-speaks-out-on-tom-hollands-future-as-spider-man-after-no-way-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a> in December. &#8220;But the thing that I can say, and this is actually the accurate scoop on this, which is that the two companies have a terrific working relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rothman added: &#8220;I think it&#8217;s a mutual hope that that would continue, but there really isn&#8217;t anything definitive at this moment because the truth of the matter is we gotta ride this puppy and see what happens.&#8221;</p>
