			<p>Elizabeth and her husband had no children before the rescue dog landed on their family. There was a difficult background for the English Pointer pooch. Because of the abuse she faced, she was scared of pretty much every person. The family doubled its size after first adopting her. They have 3 kids, 3 rescue cats, and 3 rescue dogs, so they have had some time to adjust to life in a loving family, but no one had swept her off her feet as much as baby Archie has.</p>
<p>The animals seem to respond to Archie&#8217;s laid-back, happy, good-natured nature. She seems to be right, as shown by the many pictures she takes of the adorable duo always cuddling, playing, and hanging out. They are simply the prettiest because they like to be where Archie is at all times.</p>
