			<p>We see an adequate number of corporate logos in our lives that it&#8217;s not difficult to underestimate them, yet we can see little shocks now and again that remind us how much work goes into them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s practically their job to make their jobs look easy because the masters of design have a way of doing that. The most recognizable logos tend to be simple.</p>
<p>The people who design them can sometimes slip in clever messages and hidden features that show us how creative they really are. There are many possible reasons why a designer would want to do this, but these little Easter eggs are usually slipped in with the intent of creating a subtle association with the brand.</p>
<p>One clever detail in the packaging of Toblerones would have been lost on many of us if it weren&#8217;t for one perceptive little boy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>When his mother gave him his first Toblerone, there was something about it that stuck out to him.</h2>

<p>Her son asked a question that blew her mind before he even had a bite.</p>
<p>The question? &#8220;What&#8217;s the bear for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Like a lot of her followers, she immediately asked &#8220;What bear?&#8221;.</h2>

<p>Based on some of the replies she received, it seems that children have a particular knack for discovering secret bears, as a parent discovered when they asked their son if he knew about it.</p>
<p>In their words, &#8220;I just blurted out, &#8216;Did anyone know about the Toblerone bear?&#8217; And my son replied without raising his head, &#8216;The one in the mountain? What about it?&#8217; They know things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>If you&#8217;re staring at the logo and still can&#8217;t see the bear, you can take a picture and send it to me.</h2>

<p>A bear climbing the side of the famous Matterhorn mountain has been depicted in the box&#8217;s depiction.</p>
<p>When I look at the logo again, it&#8217;s clear to me that I learned this years ago. The FedEx logo has an arrow in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>We have an answer for those who are confused as to why there is a bear in the logo.</h2>

<p>Bern, Switzerland, where Toblerone bars are produced, is also known as the City of Bears.</p>
<p>Part of the association comes from the city&#8217;s famous Bear Pit pictured here, but it also owes its very name to the animal.</p>
<p>There are bear sculptures and images all over the place.</p>
<p>That includes the packaging of its most famous exports.</p>
