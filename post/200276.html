			<p>I can say with certainty that Disneyland is the happiest place on the planet. 18 million people visit there every year.</p>
<p>Every year since 1955, the same face has appeared at the park, and it definitely stands out from the rest.</p>
<p>You thought you were a Disney fan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Dave was the first customer at Disneyland.</h2>

<p>On July 18, 1955, at 2 a.m., the 22-year-old understudy from Long Beach, California got himself a spot at the actual front of the line at the fresh out of the plastic new park.</p>
<p>&#8220;I decided I wanted to be the first in line,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The first person to go into the park who wasn&#8217;t a relative of Walt&#8217;s or some celebrity. The first regular guy to go in through the front door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Subsequent to traveling 10 miles from Long Beach to Anaheim on his cruiser, MacPherson remained before the closest ticket office and began an arrangement.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-200287" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ykEz5xienziqh4WHEp03.jpg" alt="" width="657" height="338" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ykEz5xienziqh4WHEp03.jpg 480w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ykEz5xienziqh4WHEp03-300x154.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px" /></p>
<p>Disneyland became the first regular person to enter the park on its first day when he purchased the very first ticket at sunrise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Disneyland opened its gates to Disney&#8217;s family and celebrities in 1955.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-200286" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/XV7yg8yr67RPOwdIYvkI.jpg" alt="" width="755" height="543" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/XV7yg8yr67RPOwdIYvkI.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/XV7yg8yr67RPOwdIYvkI-300x216.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px" /></p>
<p>The day was supposed to be an international press preview, but counterfeit invitations were distributed and more than 20,000 people showed up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The opening of the park was not what Walt had in mind.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-200285" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/qf7ooINlWvUMazDXBfw4.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/qf7ooINlWvUMazDXBfw4.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/qf7ooINlWvUMazDXBfw4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/qf7ooINlWvUMazDXBfw4-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The park&#8217;s refreshment stands ran out of food and drinks quickly. The hot California weather and long ride lines made for some pretty miserable guests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The park officially opened to the rest of us on the 18th.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-200284" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sjH4yn4bdzsHaUtdkLT8.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1441" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sjH4yn4bdzsHaUtdkLT8.jpg 2160w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sjH4yn4bdzsHaUtdkLT8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sjH4yn4bdzsHaUtdkLT8-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sjH4yn4bdzsHaUtdkLT8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sjH4yn4bdzsHaUtdkLT8-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/sjH4yn4bdzsHaUtdkLT8-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" /></p>
<p>It only took seven weeks for Disneyland to reach 1 million visitors. America&#8217;s newest and greatest tourist attraction was it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He didn&#8217;t get the chance to shake the hand of Disney himself.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-200283" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VUiCunUmlm9iRIrq4ZyG.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="649" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VUiCunUmlm9iRIrq4ZyG.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VUiCunUmlm9iRIrq4ZyG-296x300.jpg 296w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VUiCunUmlm9iRIrq4ZyG-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>After welcoming guests into the park, Walt almost vanished, likely to let the guests enjoy the attractions without distraction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>MacPherson was the park&#8217;s first-ever customer and was rewarded with lifetime passes.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-200282" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/7ycvuTFoOrBLzhsPunho.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="391" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Each January I eagerly await the arrival of the next installment of the pass which is then good for another year at any Disney park, and I have received these annual passes since 1955,&#8221; the 86-year-old said.</p>
<p>These cards read &#8220;VIP MAIN ENTRANCE PASS&#8221; on the front and feature his name on the park, as well as &#8220;Admit Passholder and 3 Guests.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>MacPherson uses those passes every year.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-200281" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NuJyBwmYSTRxJs2Ecl4B.jpg" alt="" width="729" height="547" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NuJyBwmYSTRxJs2Ecl4B.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/NuJyBwmYSTRxJs2Ecl4B-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px" /></p>
<p>He has been coming back to the park every year since 1955, and he has no intentions of stopping anytime soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He has to show a photo ID to enter the park.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-200280" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/aBe8ZNMgFM8PR1R5HaE9.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1131" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/aBe8ZNMgFM8PR1R5HaE9.jpg 2160w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/aBe8ZNMgFM8PR1R5HaE9-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/aBe8ZNMgFM8PR1R5HaE9-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/aBe8ZNMgFM8PR1R5HaE9-768x402.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/aBe8ZNMgFM8PR1R5HaE9-1536x804.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/aBe8ZNMgFM8PR1R5HaE9-2048x1072.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" /></p>
<p>MacPherson needs to prove that he is the first-ever customer, so he brings along some clippings from the park&#8217;s opening to prove it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He said he&#8217;s become something of a celebrity among Disney fans who recognize him and his honor.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-200279" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/KUCm151O1f5FjL0SakwF.jpg" alt="" width="608" height="502" /></p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t unusual after I give a copy of that scrapbook page to anyone manning the entrance gate, to have that official shout to the crowd, &#8216;Folks, this man bought the first ticket to Disneyland when it opened in 1955&#8217;,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t believe how many folks from different parts of the world have then come over and asked for my autograph or shot a picture of my wife, Wanda, and myself!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Being known as the first man to ever enter the park is a small perk of fame.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-200278" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/X2sv8ItIrqfTiIUcseb5.jpg" alt="" width="761" height="568" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/X2sv8ItIrqfTiIUcseb5.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/X2sv8ItIrqfTiIUcseb5-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px" /></p>
<p>The real pleasure for MacPherson is the memories of that day and the history he made, simply by taking a chance late one night and getting on his motorcycle to drive to Anaheim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being the first member of the public to buy a ticket at Disneyland on July 18, 1955, and seeing the 6,000 people behind me in line when the gates opened, and seeing Walt Disney himself is something I will never forget,&#8221; he said.</p>
