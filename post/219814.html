			<p>Fans are shocked that they don&#8217;t recognize Sharon Osbourne in recent pictures of her that were taken while she and her son were out house hunting. This has caused a bit of a stir among people who like Sharon Osbourne.</p>
<p>A source says that 70-year-old Sharon was seen looking for a house with her son Jack, whose fiancee Aree Gearhart and their daughter Maple were also there.</p>
<p>Before they went house hunting, the family was seen laughing and joking around. Sharon, who loves her granddaughter very much, was seen making funny faces at her.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Sunday Times from the year before, the former judge on X-Factor said that she had a facelift that made her look older than she really is.</p>
<p>In October 2021, she had surgery, but she wasn&#8217;t happy with the results. She said,</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m telling you, it was horrendous. I&#8217;m, like, You&#8217;ve got to be f***** joking. One eye was different to the other. I looked like a f***** Cyclops. I&#8217;m, like, &#8216;All I need is a hunchback!</p></blockquote>
<p>Sharon&#8217;s 74-year-old rock star husband, Ozzy Osbourne, offered to pay for it to be fixed, but Sharon said it didn&#8217;t matter how much it cost because it just needed to be redone.</p>
<p>The TV personality has been open about the different procedures she has had over the course of her career, telling a source that she has had:</p>
<blockquote><p>A gastric bypass, tummy tuck, a boob job, a double mastectomy, breast reconstruction surgery, and five face lifts.</p></blockquote>

<h6></h6>
<p>Any way you look at it, the release of new photos of the family looking for a new home has made fans even more worried.</p>
<p>As soon as the pictures were uploaded to Facebook and shared, followers, started posting their thoughts and reactions in the section that was made for that. One person said:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I walked past her I&#8217;d never recognize her.</p></blockquote>

<p>A second person added,</p>
<blockquote><p>Good grief, I wouldn&#8217;t of recognised her. Dreadful!&#8221; and a third said: &#8220;I woould [sic] not have recognized her as Sharon.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another one said,</p>

<p>Sharon has said that the procedures are painful, but she is the one who chooses to go through with them, so she is not looking for sympathy.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this month, fans of Sharon&#8217;s close friend Simon Cowell said they didn&#8217;t recognize him because he had a new face.</p>
<p>The TV mogul was recently in a video encouraging people to try out for the last season of Britain&#8217;s Got Talent. However, his call for talented people to try out has been put on hold because fans are worried about how he looks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Check out the video below.</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fear of getting old. Simon Cowell completely ruins his face. <a href="https://t.co/7r41kKRmS5">pic.twitter.com/7r41kKRmS5</a></p>

<p>Cowell is almost unrecognizable in the video because his skin is so smooth, his features are better, and his famous white teeth are shining.</p>
<p>Fans are worried that these traits could be caused by using cosmetics, and they have taken to social media to say so.</p>
<p>A fan tweeted,</p>
<blockquote><p>Holy moly I nearly didn&#8217;t recognise him then&#8221; and another added: &#8220;What has happened to this poor chaps face. And hair?</p></blockquote>

<p>Another person said,</p>
