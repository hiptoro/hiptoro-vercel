			<p>Every now and then we hear stories where a person seems to surprise us with their intelligence. How humans behave that we&#8217;re convinced they couldn&#8217;t possibly have happened.</p>
<p>Like there are people who still can&#8217;t buy the fact that leap year is real. Seriously? Does this thing even make sense? After listening to stuff like this, we are left with a thought that is there any bizarre lengths the right person won&#8217;t go to.</p>
<p>The bizarreness of a human is often revealed with customers who happens to be the reasonable one in the exchange.</p>
<div class="xl:w-160" data-viewed="1" data-article-card="introduction">
<div class="mt-9 xl:mt-11 px-3.5 xl:px-0">
<div class="article-text-content font-montserrat font-medium text-base leading-6 text-gray-600">
<p>However, it seems that the customer in question needed a little encouragement to see that in the story we&#8217;ll be looking at today.</p>

<h2 class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">The person we&#8217;re about to hear from is known to have a &#8220;permanent babyface,&#8221; so they&#8217;re used to being carded.</h2>

<div class="article-text-content font-montserrat font-medium text-base leading-6 text-gray-600">
<p>However, as they explained in a Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/qvy6gz/aita_for_getting_a_cashier_in_trouble_because_he/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a>, &#8220;they ran into some trouble while they were trying to buy wine, cat litter, and bleach because the cashier (named Kevin) was apparently convinced that their ID was fake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only that, but he somehow suggested that they would be using the bleach to get high in a way that he never specified.</p>

<h2 class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">And when the customer asked him what made him think that, Kevin replied that they couldn&#8217;t have been born on February 29 because there&#8217;s no such day.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://imgb.srgcdn.com/qZX3Lg0ehbiyGOR125gn.png" /></p>
<p>This argument caused confusion. Unfortunately, the customer couldn&#8217;t explain the very concept of leap years because Kevin was about to cut their ID up.</p>
<p>As for why he didn&#8217;t think there was such a date as of February 29, he later said, &#8220;No, leap years are a myth from Greece before the church took over, they aren&#8217;t real.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yeah, your guess is as good as mine as to where Kevin heard that one from.</p>
<h2 class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">However, before he could find the scissors and destroy the ID, one of Kevin&#8217;s coworkers stepped in and asked what he was doing.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://imgb.srgcdn.com/MQZf8qDCFbOIwEr73Gyj.png" /></p>
<p>This made the customer extremely sad and anxious to the point where he was about to cry. The confrontations stemming from a case of PTSD, so the woman apologized for her coworker and finished checking them out.</p>

<div class="article-text-content font-montserrat font-medium text-base leading-6 text-gray-600">
<p>Once this transaction finished, the woman asked the customer to sign a statement describing what Kevin had done.</p>
<p>When asked why, the woman said, &#8220;Because no one believes me when he does this thing and I need it in paper so I can get him reported.&#8221;</p>

<p>As one user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/qvy6gz/aita_for_getting_a_cashier_in_trouble_because_he/hkzb5gx/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">put it</a>, &#8220;Kevin would have destroyed your ID and cost you a lot of time and money to get it replaced because of his arrogance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another person thought that the coworker&#8217;s request for the customer to sign the statement was very telling, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/qvy6gz/aita_for_getting_a_cashier_in_trouble_because_he/hkzawy8/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying</a>, &#8220;If he gets fired it&#8217;s because he&#8217;s done many similar things, not just this.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">Eventually, the customer returned with an update that appreciated the responses they received, but also revealed a detail that explains the roommate&#8217;s reaction.</h2>
<div style="width: 640px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-0-11" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://imgb.srgcdn.com/QzPAAPvWZvteSuHwUwCl.mp4?_=11" /><a href="https://imgb.srgcdn.com/QzPAAPvWZvteSuHwUwCl.mp4">https://imgb.srgcdn.com/QzPAAPvWZvteSuHwUwCl.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>Turns out the roommate was actually a friend of Kevin&#8217;s and didn&#8217;t want to see him lose his job no matter how badly he deserved it.</p>
