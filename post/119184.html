			<p>This entire year has been a big mess for all of us. Thanks to the little bundles of joy in our lives who make things better. We don&#8217;t mean babies here but instead are referring to out loving pets. You don&#8217;t feel like leaving them alone at home. But unfortunately, you can&#8217;t take them to every place we go. They make our world happier, and never let a dull moment effect us when they are by our side. If you are sad because you can&#8217;t take you pet to the places you visit, the story that we are sharing with you today, might give you some hope.</p>
<h2>Ba Dun is an adorable 1-year-old Munchkin cat from China</h2>

<p>A video recently went viral on Douyin, in which this camly sitting fur ball was lying on a school desk. Ms. Wen, the owner of the cat has to take this one-year-old cat to his classroom as he didn&#8217;t allow him to leave home without him.</p>
<h2>Recently, he’s been secretly brought to a university class by his owner after not letting her leave home without him</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-119186 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-117.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1244" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-117.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-117-169x300.jpg 169w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-117-576x1024.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>“Ba Dun kept cuddling up to my leg and looking really sad because he wanted me to stay with him,” Ba Dun’s owner told MailOnline. “But I was running late for my class. I couldn’t bear letting him down so I brought him with me to the classroom.”</p>
<h2>The footage capturing Ba Dun calmly sitting inside a classroom desk has been shared online and quickly went viral</h2>
<p>https://youtu.be/nCfV8r755tc</p>
<p>As you can see in this footage, Ba Dun is trying to keep himself out of the way of others. He was being really good and didn’t make any sounds,” the owner explained in the interview. The lecturer was unaware about the whole thing until the video went viral.</p>
<h2>The lecturer didn’t notice anything unusual and only found out about this after the video went viral</h2>

<p>You must be wondering, yes, the cat’s name is Ba Dun, and it can be closely translated to “eight meals.” “He could definitely eat eight meals every day if I let him,” the owner told Hiptoro while explaining the origin of it. <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-119188 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-116.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1244" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-116.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-116-169x300.jpg 169w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-116-576x1024.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
