			<p>We all know that it can be hard to meet people online. But what would you do if you found out that someone on Tinder was a criminal who was on a list of people who were wanted? TikToker Sigler (@adriellecherrie) talks about this in a video that has been watched more than 3.2 million times.</p>

<blockquote><p>Every week they share the most wanted list,</p></blockquote>
<p>she says.</p>
<blockquote><p>They share a most wanted list, and a couple nights later, I saw this guy on Tinder, who’s also most wanted!</p></blockquote>
<p>It looks like the guy whose name was written as &#8220;Mitch&#8221; is a stalker. Sigler says she saw the profile and knew the picture from the Facebook page for her local police. The post is on the police department&#8217;s page for Jamestown, New York. &#8220;Stalking&#8221; was one of the crimes that Mitch, aka Mitchel Constanza, was charged with.</p>

<p>Local news said that Constanza &#8220;was charged with second-degree criminal contempt and fourth-degree criminal mischief&#8221; after he allegedly broke the window of a home.</p>
<blockquote><p>An investigation found that Costanzo violated an order of protection to stay away from a woman inside the residence,</p></blockquote>
<p>a report says.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, he was charged with &#8220;two counts of first-degree criminal contempt, endangering the welfare of a child, and reckless driving after he allegedly broke a Family Court order of protection and drove a car in a way that puts a child in danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sigler says she isn&#8217;t sure how she feels, though:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the people who are wanted have their mugshot permanently stamped to the Facebook profile, forever,</p></blockquote>
<p>she explains.</p>
<blockquote><p>That means, say they are charged of a crime, they go to prison, they’re released from prison, they’re reentering society, but these pictures will ruin their reputation for life.</p></blockquote>
