			<p>The richest person in the world is Elon Musk, who has a net worth of more than a quarter of a trillion dollars.</p>
<p>Musk says he isn&#8217;t different from the rest of us when it comes to his sleeping habits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Musk gave an interview recently.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-201828" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/145ecfba-6000-45f2-948a-324cc288866d.jpeg" alt="" width="1904" height="953" /></p>
<p>According to Musk, he does a lot of couch surfing. He claimed that he doesn&#8217;t own a home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wait a minute. Elon Musk is&#8230; homeless?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-201827" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/fc2fba92-e813-4098-a2ba-775e51bc8bea.jpg" alt="" width="628" height="837" /></p>
<p>Musk is a person without a home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t even own a place right now,&#8221; Musk explained. &#8220;I&#8217;m literally staying at friends&#8217; places. If I travel to the Bay Area, which is where most of Tesla&#8217;s engineering is, I basically rotate through friends&#8217; spare bedrooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>There is nothing wrong with couch surfing.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-201826" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/c4a1eded-c34c-4dbc-911e-9e0b88e62338.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1239" /></p>
<p>The majority of us have passed out on a couple of lounge chairs presently, yet there&#8217;s a distinction between somebody who makes five figures doing it to save a couple of bucks and the individual who&#8217;s in a real sense the world&#8217;s most extravagant man getting it done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Musk was asked about wealth disparity.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-201825" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2da7b4ee-da44-4412-ad50-a0a55afed660.jpg" alt="" width="644" height="599" /></p>
<p>Income inequality is a real issue with the gap between rich and poor growing.</p>
<p>&#8220;For sure, it would be very problematic if I was spending billions of dollars a year in personal consumption, but that is not the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>He explained that like you or me, he doesn&#8217;t own a yacht. Musk has a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/elon-musk-offered-a-19-year-old-5000-to-take-down-a-twitter-account-that-tracks-his-private-jet-report-says/articleshow/89157457.cms">jet</a> for what it&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He doesn&#8217;t think his personal consumption is that high.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-201824" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/a92ca099-d4db-4658-a201-1a82a9c4ae69.jpg" alt="" width="671" height="600" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, the one exception is the plane,&#8221; he acknowledged. Musk admitted that his wealth is bonkers.</p>
<p>It seems like Musk has a weird habit of living cheaply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He said two years ago that he would sell his stuff.</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am selling almost all physical possessions. Will own no house.</p>
<p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239554148724737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s intention to not own a house might explain why he&#8217;s couch-surfing in 2022. It isn&#8217;t like Musk was promising to lose his wealth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He draws attention to himself.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-201823" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/60cda2af-2adf-4d80-9320-baced7a974e0.jpeg" alt="" width="1610" height="820" /></p>
<p>While Musk seethed at the inquiry regarding pay imbalance, he immediately transformed it into a potential chance to examine his offbeat propensities. It&#8217;s the very most recent in a long queue of eye-catching tricks, from fire battles with Russia to straight-up purchasing Twitter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>About Twitter&#8230;</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-201822" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/f85be191-45a7-4e9f-8b8a-47c9bdb9680e.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1440" /></p>
<p>While he can technically afford the company, he may not be allowed to buy it. It will be interesting to see if he continues to use his preferred social media platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He&#8217;s a unique billionaire for sure.</h2>

<p>Musk has a knack for getting into the news. Do you think he doesn&#8217;t have a home or a hotel room? Let us know what you think in the comments section of the interview.</p>
