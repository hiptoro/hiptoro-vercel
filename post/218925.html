			<p>Kirstie Alley, who was known for her work on TV and in movies, has died after a private fight with cancer.</p>
<p>On Monday, her family said,</p>
<blockquote><p>We are sad to inform you that our incredible, fierce and loving mother has passed away after a battle with cancer, only recently discovered.</p></blockquote>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-218926" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/756276752e3644ef8f8987831ef77bb8_md.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="546" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/756276752e3644ef8f8987831ef77bb8_md.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/756276752e3644ef8f8987831ef77bb8_md-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>They continued,</p>
<blockquote><p>She was surrounded by her closest family and fought with great strength, leaving us with a certainty of her never-ending joy of living and whatever adventures lie ahead. As iconic as she was on screen, she was an even more amazing mother and grandmother. We are grateful to the incredible team of doctors and nurses at the Moffitt Cancer Center for their care.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the statement, her two children wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>Our mother&#8217;s zest and passion for life, her children, grandchildren and her many animals, not to mention her eternal joy of creating, were unparalleled and leave us inspired to live life to the fullest just as she did.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not clear what kind of cancer Alley had.</p>
<p>From 1987 to 1993, Alley played Rebecca Howe on &#8220;Cheers.&#8221; This role won her both an Emmy and a Golden Globe in 1991. She went on to win her second Emmy for her part in &#8220;David&#8217;s Mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fans will also remember her as the main character in &#8220;Look Who&#8217;s Talking,&#8221; a movie from the 1980s, as well as in &#8220;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,&#8221; &#8220;It Takes Two,&#8221; and many other movies.</p>
<p>William True and Lillie Price, her two children, are the ones she&#8217;s survived by.</p>
<p>Alley was 71.</p>
