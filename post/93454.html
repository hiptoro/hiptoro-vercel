			<p>An adorable dachshund puppy is famous for his unique two-tone coat. Moo the seven-month-old canine looks like he&#8217;s half Dalmatian or cow.</p>
<p>Moo has very distinct piebald fur present almost his entire body below his head. Hence, giving him a Dalmatian-like appearance, or making it look like he&#8217;s wearing doggy pajamas.</p>
<p>The combination of Moo&#8217;s different markings on his head and body makes him unique &#8211; says his owner Victoria Hoffman.</p>
<p>Victoria 24 years old from Miami, Florida &#8211; says many people get confused and think he is wearing some kind of pajamas. Moo has received a lot of cuddly reactions from passerby and even on social media platforms.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center">Moo has very distinct piebald fur &#8211; which is when an animal has unpigmented, white, spots on a pigmented background.</h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center">He&#8217;s got it all: Victoria added that Moo also has an extra special personality, saying, &#8216;He has lots of attitudes and is super cuddly and sweet as well&#8217;</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-93462 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/30192118-8471785-image-a-65_1593453577684-e1593626002899.jpg" alt="dog" width="633" height="622" /></p>
<p>While working for a skincare beauty company, Victoria says &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;He is a unique piebald because he has heavy ticking, black spots on his white coat, and he also has a pure black and tan head. So, it looks like his body doesn&#8217;t match his head.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center">Famous! Moo often gets stopped on the street by strangers who want to take pictures of him.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-93463 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/30192134-8471785-image-m-24_1593452851126-e1593625801915.jpg" alt="puppy" width="634" height="610" /></p>
<p>Several species of dogs commonly have piebald coats. Which includes the beagle and is also common in birds, cats, cattle, horses, and even snakes.</p>
<p>Victoria revealed that even in the dark times of this pandemic, Moo has been a blessing to them. He is giving joy to many, including her and her boyfriend.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;He loves to hoard his toys in one spot, watermelon and almonds are his favorite treats, and he loves to take naps on his back under his bed. I never get bored or lonely having Moo around.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 style="text-align: center">&#8216;I don&#8217;t think that we would&#8217;ve gotten a dog if it weren&#8217;t for COVID because we wouldn&#8217;t have been home as much,&#8217; Victoria shared</h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center">The devoted pet owner said that Moo has done a great job of keeping her entertained while she has been at home</h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center">Moo&#8217;s coat is particularly special because it is so distinct from the color of his head and face</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-93469 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/30192132-8471785-image-m-55_1593453409363-e1593626336958.jpg" alt="owner" width="306" height="536" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center">He&#8217;s truly such a special little dachshund pup. He&#8217;s our little star.&#8217; says Victoria</h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center">One of a kind: &#8216;He is a unique piebald because he has heavy ticking, black spots on his white coat, and he also has a pure black and tan head,&#8217; Victoria said of Moo&#8217;s fur</h2>
