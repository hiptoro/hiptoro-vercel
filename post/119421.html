			<p>Shauna Darcy, a patient suffering from agoraphobia, tension and depression got Ruby as her service dog. This loyal and faithful dog didi not leave her regardless of anything.</p>
<p>As Darcy said, “While she was training to be a service dog I noticed that she started picking up on changes in my heart rate and would act funny — for example, paw at me, try to get my attention, get on top of me, etc.”</p>
<h2>Meet Ruby, the loyal service dog!</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-119422 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-128.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-128.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-128-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Darcy chose to listen to Ruby&#8217;s signals and deciding to consult a doctor. She discovered that she was suffering from an uncommon heart condition called vascular Ehlers-Danlos disorder. Before Darcy could realize her problems, her service dog could Ruby figured that something was not right. <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-119423 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-128.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-128.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-128-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Ruby did whatever was possible for her to help Darcy to support her during the treatment. From picking things up for her to snathing the things she couldn&#8217;t pick herself, she didi it all. <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-119424 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-128.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-128.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-128-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />“When I pass out she gets on top of me and applies all her pressure on me and licks my hands and face until I come around,” Darcy stated. <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-119425 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-125.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-125.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-125-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Ruby did save her life by alarming her about her condition all the time. She never left Darcy alone and made sure that she was alright always.</p>
<p>“It turns out my heart was going into atrial fibrillation,” Darcy stated. “By the time the paramedics came, I was in pain and barely conscious.” <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-119426 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-125.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-125.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-125-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>When Darcy and Ruby were in the hospital, many people came across Ruby and loved her. But having so many admirers, Ruby did not leave the side of her Mamma in any case. <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-119427 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-120.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-120.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-120-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" />Ruby was underestimated by each one in the hospital but her loyalty and love proved everyone wrong. Darcy and Ruby&#8217;s story went viral on the Internet and got a lot of love from the audience worldwide.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be alive without her,” Darcy said.</p>
