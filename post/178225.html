			<p>This world has become a selfish place where no one cares about others. Forget others, some people are not even concerned for their own family members.</p>
<p>But not this devoted son who scaled an apartment building that was on fire in order to save his mother who was trapped on the 15th floor.</p>
<h2>A mother would do anything for her child – and vice versa.</h2>

<h2>So, it’s no surprise that a child would do the same for their mother.</h2>

<h2>Jermaine showed that kind of love for his mother with his heroic act.</h2>
<figure class=""></figure>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178229" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-29.png" alt="" width="867" height="783" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-29.png 867w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-29-300x271.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-29-768x694.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 867px) 100vw, 867px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;He received a call from his sister that evening that there was a fire at their mother’s residential building. Their mother was bedridden, and they fear she may not save herself from the fire.&#8221;</p>
<h2>In a heartbeat, he went to the building to make sure his mother is safe, only to be stopped by the police.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178230" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-27.png" alt="" width="867" height="782" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-27.png 867w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-27-300x271.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-27-768x693.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 867px) 100vw, 867px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;He was told that the elevator couldn’t be used in case of fire, and they were not letting him up the stairs either.&#8221;</p>
<h2>With no other choice, plus the urge and panic to save his mom, he did the unbelievable.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178231" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-23.png" alt="" width="867" height="777" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-23.png 867w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-23-300x269.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-23-768x688.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 867px) 100vw, 867px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;He climbed to the 15th floor from the building’s walls. He found the gate and hung in there, found a ledge on top of it where he can step, and repeated this until he got to his mother.&#8221;</p>
<h2>It turns out Jermaine has the “experience and training” to do such a thing.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178232" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-20.png" alt="" width="875" height="787" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-20.png 875w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-20-300x270.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-20-768x691.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;He works as a construction worker and a roofer, so he is used to the heights. Plus, he used to jump off roofs when he was a kid!&#8221;</p>
<h2>And here’s another amazing feat: he did so with a broken hip.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178233" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-18.png" alt="" width="871" height="780" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-18.png 871w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-18-300x269.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7-18-768x688.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 871px) 100vw, 871px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Earlier that day, he cracked his hips and was walking on crutches. Adrenaline must have pushed that injury aside that he powered through it.&#8221;</p>
<h2>When he reached his mother’s room, he immediately ran to her to check if she’s okay.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178234" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/8-16.png" alt="" width="868" height="782" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/8-16.png 868w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/8-16-300x270.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/8-16-768x692.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 868px) 100vw, 868px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;He said his mother was shocked to see him. She assured him that she is okay and that help was on the way. He was at peace with that reassurance, and that’s all he ever wanted to hear.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Jermaine may have broken the safety protocol, but the officers understood his side.</h2>
<p>He shared what the police told him:</p>
<blockquote><p>“He told me if I didn’t leave, I was going straight to jail. Because that was his job… He understood the circumstances, he knew – when your adrenaline is pumping, and your mom is up there, you thinking she’s dying – you’d do anything you can.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>When asked about why he did what he did, Jermaine’s answer was simple:</h2>
<blockquote><p>“All for my mom’s safety, period.”</p></blockquote>
