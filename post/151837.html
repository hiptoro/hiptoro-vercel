			<p>You need to be very careful when using reverse psychology on people. If it not always that it will work in your favour, sometimes it can backfire you.</p>
<p>Some parents who succeeded in apply reverse psychology to their children have some information that they have shared with everyone. So, let&#8217;s see what and how this formula works in reality.</p>
<h2>1</h2>
<figure id="attachment_151857" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151857" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-151857 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-34.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-34.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-34-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-151857" class="wp-caption-text">Took my 3 year old son to one of those doctor&#8217;s visits where he was going to get a shot. He was worried about the shot on the whole drive over, almost to the point of tears. We get to the doctor&#8217;s office and a nurse subtly lets me know that my son is not just scheduled for 1 shot, but 5 of them in the same visit. I turn to my son with an exaggerated smile and tell him, &#8220;Good news! They figured out how to take that one big shot you were going to get and instead break it up into these 5 little tiny shots so it won&#8217;t hurt nearly as much!&#8221; You could see the relief wash over his face. He stopped squirming and relaxed completely. He took the first shot and even smiled and said &#8220;It&#8217;s true! The small ones don&#8217;t hurt!&#8221; We actually made it through the third shot before the effect wore off and reality kicked in. Still&#8230; I counted it as a victory.</figcaption></figure>

When the kids asked she would be reluctant to share, &#8220;that&#8217;s grown up food. But I suppose I can let you have a little.&#8221; Her kids grew up loving vegetables. I sat at the dinner table for 3 hours staring at the yucky cauliflower I refused to eat.</figcaption></figure>

My mom said we were going to trick my dad into thinking I was still asleep. So she made me put on clothes and then hide under the covers and pretend to be asleep. Then my dad would come in to wake me up and I would &#8220;fool&#8221; him because I was already dressed and ready. This worked on me for years and I never questioned it. In hindsight it&#8217;s pretty obvious that my parents just wanted me to get dressed without a fuss.</figcaption></figure>

She cherishes salad now and would always try to eat as much as possible during school lunch. Coincidentally, her now husband used to be punished with no books, it had the same effect. I think it&#8217;s hilarious that they&#8217;d be hitting the salad bar and library like some black market their narc parents couldn&#8217;t reach hahaha.</figcaption></figure>

It was up to me to either get up and engage with him or send him off on some mission so as to grab a few more precious minutes of shut-eye. One I&#8217;m proud of was telling him to find out which of his legs could run the fastest. He was charging around the corridor for ages doing a kind of manic goose-step before he came back in panting that they were both the same.</figcaption></figure>

When there were chores that needed doing, he noticed if he asked me to mow the lawn, I would complain and procrastinate. But if he asked would I rather mow the lawn or wash the windows, I&#8217;d pick one and just get it done. Shattered my brain when he told me when I was in my twenties. I use it when I&#8217;m coaching or baby sitting all the time and it almost never fails.</figcaption></figure>

Now, my son was a rather small, wiry, hyperkinetic kid &#8211; not at all a football player or weightlifter type. Yet I noticed starting when he was around 13 that if something heavy or heavy-ish needed moving, he was always right there, with a need to show he could do it. I took full advantage. I don&#8217;t think I lifted anything heavier than my purse until he moved out. All I had to do was mention that I was going to put X in Y place (put the suitcases in the car for vacation, carry that gigantic load of laundry upstairs, etc.), and pretend like it was too heavy for me and he would appear as if summoned from the universe to do it for me. The reverse psychology aspect was my saying &#8220;Oh my! That looks heavy!&#8221; and him proving to me that &#8220;No it&#8217;s not!&#8221;</figcaption></figure>

One day I was home alone and had the opportunity to grabbed it. I read like half of it in one go. It was 5000 years of Chinese history. Safe to say I was bamboozled.</figcaption></figure>
