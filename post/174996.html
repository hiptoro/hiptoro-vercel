			<p>They say you should never disturb the person who handles your food. Similarly, the last person you want to care about on your wedding day is your vendor.</p>
<p>After being denied break and mealtimes, the couple&#8217;s photographers deleted all wedding photos on the spot. His actions vibrate social media and ask if he is right and if he has done things too much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>An anonymous photographer using the Reddit identifier Icy-Reserve6995 shared her experience on the AITA thread.</h2>

<p>She starts posting by quickly explaining that she is not a professional photographer. Dog grooming was her chosen profession, and she did it in favor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>&#8220;I take a lot of dog pictures all day and post them on Facebook and Instagram. If that makes sense, it&#8217;s me,&#8221; she explained.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175000" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pOnC5OlJQ4kG0XTXnffF.png" alt="" width="2160" height="1622" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pOnC5OlJQ4kG0XTXnffF.png 2160w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pOnC5OlJQ4kG0XTXnffF-300x225.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pOnC5OlJQ4kG0XTXnffF-1024x769.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pOnC5OlJQ4kG0XTXnffF-768x577.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pOnC5OlJQ4kG0XTXnffF-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/pOnC5OlJQ4kG0XTXnffF-2048x1538.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" /></p>
<p>According to Icy-Reserve6995, it contains pictures of dogs cut and rarely takes anything other than dogs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Next, Redditor explains how one of her friends, who is about to get married asks her if she wants to photograph his wedding.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-175001" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kk96jrVTBwMcHZEPR9zB.gif" alt="" width="648" height="540" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I said it wasn&#8217;t my strength, but he convinced me that they didn&#8217;t care if they were perfect. They were on a tight budget and I agreed to shoot it for $ 250. This is nothing in 10 hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Icy-Reserve6995 is not joking though. $250 isn&#8217;t a bad deal after all!</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175002" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0ATxR5hV0FiwqslCMk0D.png" alt="" width="2160" height="1622" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0ATxR5hV0FiwqslCMk0D.png 2160w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0ATxR5hV0FiwqslCMk0D-300x225.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0ATxR5hV0FiwqslCMk0D-1024x769.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0ATxR5hV0FiwqslCMk0D-768x577.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0ATxR5hV0FiwqslCMk0D-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/0ATxR5hV0FiwqslCMk0D-2048x1538.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" /></p>
<p>As a married person, let me tell you, it&#8217;s very expensive. According to a recent article on <a href="https://www.weddingwire.com/cost/wedding-photographer">WeddingWire</a>, the average cost of a wedding photo in the United States is about $2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The day started early with bridal photography.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-175003" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/xauDSYDBwMjGcA5AJDT1.gif" alt="" width="769" height="641" /></p>
<p>After she finished taking pictures of the bride preparing, Icy-Reserve 6995 followed her various appointments on the wedding day and took pictures as they went.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>&#8220;I record the ceremony myself, and at the reception, and recording a mix of speeches and people conversating,&#8221; she mentioned.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175004" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mrmgdWoSS8w6Ql8WGT07.png" alt="" width="2160" height="1624" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mrmgdWoSS8w6Ql8WGT07.png 2160w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mrmgdWoSS8w6Ql8WGT07-300x226.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mrmgdWoSS8w6Ql8WGT07-1024x770.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mrmgdWoSS8w6Ql8WGT07-768x577.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mrmgdWoSS8w6Ql8WGT07-1536x1155.png 1536w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mrmgdWoSS8w6Ql8WGT07-2048x1540.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" /></p>
<p>As Icy-Reserve6995 states, her day had begun around 11:30 am. She was scheduled to take pictures until about 7:30 pm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Icy-Reserve6995 was hungry and thought that since dinner was being served it was time for a break.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-175005" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1vynq1aF98LnT35tpDF0.gif" alt="" width="811" height="456" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The food is served around 5 pm and I was told I couldn&#8217;t eat because I had to be a photographer,&#8221; she said. &#8220;In fact, they didn&#8217;t even reserve a table for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>By this time of the night, frustration had begun to subside.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175006" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/m93vXkQ8vT1I2W4X7J2h.png" alt="" width="2160" height="1622" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/m93vXkQ8vT1I2W4X7J2h.png 2160w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/m93vXkQ8vT1I2W4X7J2h-300x225.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/m93vXkQ8vT1I2W4X7J2h-1024x769.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/m93vXkQ8vT1I2W4X7J2h-768x577.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/m93vXkQ8vT1I2W4X7J2h-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/m93vXkQ8vT1I2W4X7J2h-2048x1538.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired and at this point, I&#8217;m a little disappointed that I did it with almost nothing,&#8221; said Icy-Reserve 6995. &#8220;It&#8217;s also incredibly hot. The place is in an old veteran corps, like 110F, with no air conditioning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>On the verge of starvation, Icy-Reserve6995 approached the groom and told him that she needed a break for 20 minutes.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-175007" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/g4joKVkBAsOvs7v6H1SO.gif" alt="" width="794" height="430" /></p>
<p>The bride and groom did not consider feeding the vendors. There was no open bar, so Icy-Reserve 6995 couldn&#8217;t even get bottled water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>&#8220;He told me I had to be a photographer or had to go unpaid.&#8221;</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175008" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RN6FnUMiivC6HxBipkrM.png" alt="" width="2160" height="1622" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RN6FnUMiivC6HxBipkrM.png 2160w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RN6FnUMiivC6HxBipkrM-300x225.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RN6FnUMiivC6HxBipkrM-1024x769.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RN6FnUMiivC6HxBipkrM-768x577.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RN6FnUMiivC6HxBipkrM-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/RN6FnUMiivC6HxBipkrM-2048x1538.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" /></p>
<p>Icy-Reserve6995 was shocked and surprised at how her friend spoke to her. She processed his words and then asked if he was being serious.</p>
<p>He replied that was the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Without hesitation, Icy-Reserve 6995 took out the camera and erased all the photos taken in front of the groom.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175009" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qpFzIhsC9dUwZElpsuus.png" alt="" width="2160" height="1620" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qpFzIhsC9dUwZElpsuus.png 2160w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qpFzIhsC9dUwZElpsuus-300x225.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qpFzIhsC9dUwZElpsuus-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qpFzIhsC9dUwZElpsuus-768x576.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qpFzIhsC9dUwZElpsuus-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qpFzIhsC9dUwZElpsuus-2048x1536.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" /></p>
<p>The $250 payday was negligible. Icy-Reserve6995 said that she would have been willing to pay $250 for a glass of cold water and a light meal at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The majority of Reddit users support the Icy-Reserve 6995 decision.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-175010" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/WIThIAvdTYwcWpQYtLY2.gif" alt="" width="766" height="638" /></p>
<p>Today, it is common to include meals for vendors at weddings. How would you feel if you worked all day and did not get anything to eat?</p>
<p>Respect the vendors or take the risk of consequences for treating them badly.</p>
