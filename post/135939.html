			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the quotes on people’s clothes, it’s safe to say that they don’t know what they are wearing. Because if they did, they won’t be wearing something like that. These are simple quotes and simple words but wearing them is making these people look like a fool. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You can scroll down to see a whole bunch of people in China who don’t know what they are wearing. </span></p>
<h2><strong>1. This is a classic one</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135944 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-6.png" alt="" width="686" height="573" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-6.png 686w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-6-300x251.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /></p>
<p>This witty saying is quite popular and we love it, but we are certain that this girl cropped her face accidentally and because she wanted to make this a funny photo.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Here is a curious shirt</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135948 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-129.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-129.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-129-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-129-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2-129-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>We guess that this person also had no idea what the shirt says, otherwise, he would wear a more positive one.</p>
<h2><strong>3. This is an awkward moment</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135949 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-123.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-123.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-123-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-123-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-123-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The shirt this man chose to wear is really funny but he had no way of knowing that.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Here is an inappropriate child outfit</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135951 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-126.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-126.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-126-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-126-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-126-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The kid could not care less about how his hoodie looks like, but the mother probably even liked the lettering color.</p>
<h2><strong>5. This is a curious detail</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135953 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-7.png" alt="" width="686" height="591" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-7.png 686w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/5-7-300x258.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px" /></p>
<p>This girl either lost a bet or she really needs a crash course in eyelash extension application!</p>
<h2><strong>6. We assume that this girl may actually be aware of what the lettering on her shirt says</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135956 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-124.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-124.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-124-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-124-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-124-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>We cannot be sure about this, but we can only judge by her facial expression! That is one funny T-shirt!</p>
<h2><strong>7. Here is one curious balloon</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135959 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7-122.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7-122.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7-122-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7-122-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7-122-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>We sure do hope that they did not buy this balloon from the amusement park for obvious reasons!</p>
<h2><strong>8. That is a bold statement</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135961 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/8-124.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="768" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/8-124.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/8-124-273x300.jpg 273w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>This is one jacket that really makes a statement and we doubt that the woman wearing it knew its meaning!</p>
<h2><strong>9. Here is one way to say ‘good morning’</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135963 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9-116.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="856" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9-116.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9-116-245x300.jpg 245w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>This is not the most appropriate thing to wear while grocery shopping, but hardly anyone knew what it said.</p>
<h2><strong>10. We want that shirt</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135965 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10-118.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="875" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10-118.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10-118-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>This is definitely something we can relate to, and we hope this girl knew what her shirt actually said!</p>
<h2><strong>11. Here is not something to be proud of</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135966 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11-117.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11-117.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11-117-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11-117-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11-117-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Everyone who can read in English would probably cringe upon seeing this man wearing a shirt like that!</p>
<h2><strong>12. Here is a girl who wanted to show she can be extra</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135968 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12-111.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12-111.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12-111-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12-111-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12-111-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>We are more than certain that she only wanted to make a statement and she would not be able to eat all those snacks!</p>
<h2><strong>13. This toddler wears a jacket that is a bit oversized</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135969 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/13-117.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="782" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/13-117.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/13-117-269x300.jpg 269w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>We guess that the woman probably had a reason to put on that huge jacket on the toddler.</p>
<h2><strong>14. How about nope</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135970 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/14-113.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/14-113.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/14-113-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/14-113-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/14-113-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>There are many different accessories that may be considered controversial, but these shoes are even more than that! They are ridiculous!</p>
<h2><strong>15. We wish this wasn’t true</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135971 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/15-113.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="875" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/15-113.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/15-113-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>This person probably does not realize that the quote on the back of her shirt is the harsh truth!</p>
<h2><strong>16. Here is another surprisingly inspirational quote</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135972 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16-107.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16-107.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16-107-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16-107-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16-107-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>It seems that people in China have the ability to pick clothing with wise quotes printed on them!</p>
<h2><strong>17. Well, this is awkward</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135973 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17-105.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17-105.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17-105-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17-105-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/17-105-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>This is definitely one of the weirdest images on the list. This person will not be happy if someone translates that sentence to her.</p>
<h2><strong>18. There is one very serious question here</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135974 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/18-99.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="478" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/18-99.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/18-99-300x205.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>It is more than clear that the mom had no idea what that word means, but the question is who would produce kids’ clothing featuring that same word?</p>
<h2><strong>19. Well, at least they tried</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135975 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/19-96.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/19-96.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/19-96-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/19-96-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/19-96-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>It is more than obvious what they tried to write on that bag, but the uplifting quote backfired!</p>
<h2><strong>20. There must be a reason for this</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135976 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20-89.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20-89.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20-89-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20-89-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20-89-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>We really tried to find a reasonable explanation for this image, but we simply could not! It is too weird!</p>
<h2><strong>21. This is another weird choice for decorating a piece of kids’ clothing</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135977 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/21-75.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="789" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/21-75.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/21-75-266x300.jpg 266w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>We have no idea what the other kids are so happy about. but we guess they don’t have a clue what lettering means.</p>
<h2><strong>22. Someone should tell her that she got this wrong</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135978 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22-69.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="875" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22-69.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22-69-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Well, we can only wonder why this girl decided to wear that top backward. Maybe she was really sleepy in the morning!</p>
<h2><strong>23. This is more than hilarious</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135979 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/23-67.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/23-67.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/23-67-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/23-67-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/23-67-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>We guess that this brand sounds even better than North Face! They copied that brand here, obviously.</p>
<h2><strong>24. Here is another ridiculous outfit</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135980 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/24-65.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/24-65.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/24-65-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/24-65-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/24-65-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>This girl probably wondered why some people stared at her, but they were just able to read what her pullover said!</p>
<h2><strong>25. Here is yet another example of inappropriate kids’ clothing</strong></h2>

<p>While we admit that the lettering is more than funny, it is not appropriate for a child to wear it!</p>

<p>This boy looks proud about something but it is definitely not the lettering on his shirt!</p>
<h2><strong>27. Someone thought that this was a nice quote for a kids’ blouse</strong></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135983 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/27-59.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="746" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/27-59.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/27-59-282x300.jpg 282w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
