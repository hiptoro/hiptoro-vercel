When starting an early career on such a massive level, you tend to make mistakes every now and then. The same is the case with Millie. The 18-year-old actress is also the<span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"> titular character in Netflix&#8217;s mystery movie franchise <i>Enola Holmes. </i>Her fans were glad to see</span><span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"> kiss Lord Tewkesbury, played by Louis Patridge. However, an intimacy coordinator has ridiculed Millie for her remarks where she claims she did not seek consent before kissing Louis during rehearsals and called it &#8220;cute.&#8221;</span><span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"> Jessica Steinrock shared her thoughts in a TikTok video.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">She captioned the video, &#8220;</span><span class="js-subbuzz__title-text">Consent is mandatory. We don’t need to surprise kiss, we don’t need to actually hit…&#8221; In the video, she said, &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 16px">I love Millie Bobby Brown but this is not the cute story you think it is. I’m sure she and her scene partner have a lot of rapport built up and a great amount of trust, but we should never be surprising anyone during a fight or intimate scene ever. </span><span class="js-subbuzz__title-text">At the end of the day, this basically means she didn’t ask consent to kiss him.&#8221; She continued to explain that if the person on the receiving end is surprised that means there was no communication and hence consent was skipped.</span></p>

<h2>Intimacy Coordinator slams Millie Bobby Brown for not seeking consent</h2>
<p class="subbuzz__header subbuzz__header--standard subbuzz__title "><span class="js-subbuzz__title-text">Jessica continued, &#8220;And when your scene partner reacts in surprise after you’ve kissed them that means the communication didn’t happen the way it really needs to. </span><span class="js-subbuzz__title-text">Little things like this can escalate over time, and frankly she has more power in that situation than he does because she’s a really well-known star. When we do spicy scenes, we love keeping light, having fun, but consent is mandatory. </span><span class="js-subbuzz__title-text">For the record, I loved <i>Enola Holmes 2</i>, but next time we have to ask consent.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>Millie Bobby Brown explained the event in a separate video. She said, &#8220;<span class="js-subbuzz__title-text">Right on the rehearsal I grabbed his face and kissed him and he was like&#8230; (shocked).&#8221; She said, &#8220;</span><span class="js-subbuzz__title-text">It was so cute really seeing her take the lead,” she went on. “And also seeing a girl (Enola Holmes) just make the first move is just really exciting. </span><span class="js-subbuzz__title-text">Because Louis is a good friend I just kept punching him, I wasn’t doing stunts, I really was hurting him. By the end of it, he said: ‘Millie can you just fake punch me,’ I was fully just getting him right in the stomach.&#8221; Millie concluded, &#8220;</span><span class="js-subbuzz__title-text">It’s a very cute scene and I think fans are going to love it.&#8221;</span></p>
