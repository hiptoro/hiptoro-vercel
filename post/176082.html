			<p>I am the nasty type of person who likes to refer to myself as a pet parent. Or, worse yet, a &#8220;pawrent&#8221;. This is what happens when you are a single millennial with no children. This is what you become.</p>
<p>As a proud pawrent, I am happy to spend time with my beloved furry baby. But I also find joy in sitting next to him as I scroll through some funny quotes that tease him in a playful, yet highly relatable way.</p>
<p>If this sounds like something you might also be interested in doing, you&#8217;re in luck because I&#8217;ve compiled a list of great quotes, just for you!</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s a risky game that he wouldn&#8217;t stop playing with me.</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Almost tripping me is not just my dog&#39;s hobby, it&#39;s also his passion.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t even tell you how many times a day I turn around and almost fall flat on my face because my dog â€‹â€‹was right at my feet, smiling at me.</p>
<p>The worst is when I&#8217;m in the kitchen. That&#8217;s where he somehow realizes that if he can trip me over the fridge and drop everything in my hand as he trips me, then maybe he&#8217;ll end up with some delicious floor scraps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Because it deserves to be warm and welcoming, even if he doesn&#8217;t want to be.</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure my dog â€‹â€‹doesn&#8217;t need blankets. In fact, he prefers to sleep by the open windows of my house because he likes to feel the cold breeze through his fur.</p>
<p>So why, I ask you, do I have six blankets that I bought exclusively for him? And why do I insist on covering him with one every night, like he&#8217;s putting my son to bed? Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Going to jump off a bridge. Be right back!</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>There is literally nothing worse than unintentionally hurting your dog because you know that beautiful little soul deserves nothing but all the joy and happiness in the world and yet you are the reason it gave a sad little scream of pain.</p>
<p>You should feel bad for doing so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why does it always have to be 3:00 A.M. though?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-176084" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/p0NuPti3BScJ9BdvGrjU.png" alt="" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/p0NuPti3BScJ9BdvGrjU.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/p0NuPti3BScJ9BdvGrjU-300x157.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/p0NuPti3BScJ9BdvGrjU-768x402.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what happens to my dog â€‹â€‹after midnight, but that&#8217;s when he sees the perfect opportunity to lick. It doesn&#8217;t matter if the whole house is quiet, it doesn&#8217;t matter if he should be sleeping and he surely doesn&#8217;t have to get up so early.</p>
<p>He will still roam around in my room, he will drop right next to my bed and go to town, so I have to wake up to that beautiful noise every night.</p>
