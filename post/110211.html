			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might have heard a lot of stories where dogs shower their love on humans. But today, we have brought a little different story for you. In this story, a cute dog is showing her affection for other dogs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The story is about Ruby who has become an Internet sensation. She is a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">German shorthaired pointer and she shows her love towards other dogs by petting them. Awww, that’s so sweet! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with her brother Miles, she goes to The Den Doggy Daycare in Burlington, Ontario. When she was going there, it was her owner who noticed this strange and cute behavior of hers. One of the dog owners at this daycare told us a few things about Ruby. She said that “Ruby does it every time she is in. We think she wants attention!” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to see how friendly and adorable Ruby is, you can scroll down.</span></p>
<h2>When one woman filmed Ruby the dog petting other dogs, her video instantly became popular on the Internet. Even the very popular We Rate Dogs Twitter account shared the news about Ruby</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spencer from The Den Doggy Daycare told us a few more things about Ruby. “She usually starts with her brother Miles and as the other dogs in daycare start to chill out, she will get to work on them as well. Miles doesn’t seem interested in giving pets, just receiving.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We think it started with trying to get Miles’ attention or to play with him and just evolved from there, most of her friends at daycare don’t mind and see it as her playing with them.” </span></p>
<h2>People couldn’t get enough of Ruby petting other dogs!</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We even asked Spencer about the daycare. He said that “For the last 3 years, we have won the award from the Burlington Post for Best Doggy Daycare. Our staff that work with the dogs are the absolute backbone of our service and are amazing with the dogs, we could never do this without the team we have.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are so grateful to see everyone enjoying the video Alanah made and now everyone gets to experience the happiness dogs like Ruby bring us every day.”</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-110215 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-22.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="829" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other dogs at this daycare center were seemed a little befuddled, confused, and bewildered at first by Ruby’s action. But sooner they started enjoying it and their reaction is priceless. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alanah who has filmed Ruby’s interesting way of showing her love said that “most dogs aren’t bothered by it and just let it happen.” Once Alanah has filmed the video, she then compiled all of the clips together to post on a social media site. She has shared Ruby’s video on Tik Tok where the video has gained 144.8k likes and 620.4k views. Besides this, the sweet video was also shared by a famous Twitter account i.e We Rate Dogs and it got nearly 7.7 million more views!</span></p>
