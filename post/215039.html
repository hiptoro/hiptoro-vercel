			<p>Katy Perry looked like she was having trouble with her eye at a recent concert, and this has led to a lot of strange theories.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old &#8220;Roar&#8221; singer appeared to have an eye problem while on stage at her Las Vegas residency. Since it was posted to TikTok a few days ago, the video has been watched more than 19 million times.</p>
<p>In the video that went viral, Perry seemed to stare right at the crowd while she had trouble opening her right eye.</p>
<p>The mom of one, who was wearing a sparkly dress with two fake soda cans on her chest, used her hand to try to move her eyelid back into place. But her eye closed again, so Perry tried again. Once her eye was back to normal, the singer of &#8220;I Kissed a Girl&#8221; went on with her show and told the crowd: &#8220;Make even more noise for my band.&#8221;</p>

<p>People had a lot to say about the clip. Some said the mistake was a mechanical problem, which made it sound like the Grammy-winning superstar was actually a robot.</p>
<p>One person wrote: &#8220;The robot had a glitch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another added: &#8220;she lost the wifi connection ðŸ˜‚.&#8221;</p>
<p>A third chimed in: &#8220;Mechanical failure ðŸ˜‚she even press that button to keep it open ðŸ˜‚.&#8221;</p>
<p>A forth commented: &#8220;Clone failure. Next time [make] sure all software are updated and make necessary patches ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fifth person said: &#8220;The cyborg is shuttin down lol.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people said that the video supported the theory that the Covid vaccine causes eye problems.</p>
<p>One wrote on Twitter: &#8220;She got that Pfizer eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another quipped: &#8220;Isnâ€™t Katy Perry the one who sings that new hot song called &#8216;Eye of the Pfizer&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people thought Perry&#8217;s makeup had something to do with the problem with her eye, which was a little less far-fetched.</p>
<p>One wrote: &#8220;Lol itâ€™s her eyelash glue getting stuck to her bottom lid happens to me all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>A second said: &#8220;That be the glue on the eye lashes my eyes always do that donâ€™t let me sneeze ðŸ¤£.&#8221;</p>
