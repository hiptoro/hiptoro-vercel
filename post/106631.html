			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every dog is special and they all deserve the same amount of love and care. However, Pepper is a little different because she needs more love. And after seeing her pictures even we can’t disagree. Also, did we mention that she came with a set of rules? Oh, yes she is pretty much spoiled and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">only queen of the canine world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, so what actually happened was that Tommy Rivers agreed to look after his aunt&#8217;s cute dog for a day. He was really very excited about it but it turns out that Pepper was not any ordinary dog. It is because she has got a whole list of things or we can say rules that everyone has to follow who is taking care of her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The interesting thing is that some of them were so hilarious and it shows how much Tommy’s aunty loves her furry friend. Besides being hilarious, the note was quite detailed. It started something like Pepper is the prettiest girl in the world, and ends with ‘don’t you hate her cause you ain’t her’. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pepper is definitely very cute and the purple accessories attached to her ears and tail made her even more adorable. Also, her cute and adorable expressions. OMG! Everything is enough to make you fall in love with her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the evening, Tommy posted a lovely picture of Pepper getting ready for bed in pajamas. “You made her really happy and now she’s going to bed.” You can scroll down to see this entire thing.</span></p>
