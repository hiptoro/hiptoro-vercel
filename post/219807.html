			<p>Lana Rhoades says she doesn&#8217;t &#8220;find people attractive&#8221; and wants adult movies to be banned.</p>
<p>Rhoades is a former adult film star and content creator who is now 26 years old. She has more than a million YouTube subscribers and more than 16.5 million Instagram followers.</p>
<p>She gave birth to her first child, a son named Milo, earlier this year. We still don&#8217;t know who his father is.</p>
<p>Rhoades joined the world of adult films when she was 19 years old. Since then, she has talked about the business and made her feelings clear.</p>
<p>In the video below, you can see Boris Johnson say that watching p*** at work is &#8220;unacceptable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rhoades said on an episode of The Skinny Confidential that when she first started out, she wasn&#8217;t sure what she was getting herself into.</p>
<p>She said,</p>
<blockquote><p>I also had only slept with one person at this point. So, I was very sexually inexperienced.</p>
<p>That’s why and for whatever reason I never comprehended like to do p*** you actually have to have s** with people.</p>
<p>It’s just the idea of, oh OK, I’m going to be like Anna Nicole Smith or I’m going to be like Holly Madison or this person it was like an idea in my head but I wasn’t mature enough to realise what actually went into it.</p>
<p>And very, very quickly I realised this isn’t for me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rhoades said that she started to think of p*** as a &#8220;job&#8221; because she had to sleep with people she didn&#8217;t always find attractive.</p>
<p>She continued by saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>I mean, essentially you’re having to have s** with people that you didn’t choose to have s** with that you might not find attractive you might actually think that they’re disgusting and you have to have s** with them because it’s your job.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>How should a 19-year-old girl be put in that position having to have s** with people that they don’t really don’t want to touch their body at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rhoades has spent her time since leaving the adult film industry making a clothing and lingerie line, and she still doesn&#8217;t like the p*** world.</p>
<p>She said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Going back to p***, I just, I don’t think that it’s good for anyone.</p>
<p>They should make it illegal.</p></blockquote>
<p>She then said that she thinks of herself as asexual because she doesn&#8217;t &#8220;find people attractive&#8221; or &#8220;hook up&#8221; with many people.</p>
<blockquote><p>Honestly, I’m pretty much asexual,</p></blockquote>
<p>said Rhoades.</p>
<blockquote><p>Pretty much like I never hook up with people, I don’t find people attractive, and I’ve always been like that it’s not like there’s like a change after doing p***.</p></blockquote>
