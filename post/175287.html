<h2 class="Title_title__2aoq1">Publishing Tycoons Decided To Fleece The Newsies Increase Their Profits</h2>

During the Spanish-American War in 1898, newspapers <a href="https://www.missedinhistory.com/podcasts/how-the-newsboy-strike-of-1899-worked-transcript.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised </a>a bundle of papers to 60 cents, cutting into the newsboys&#8217; profits.</p>
<div class="richText_container__4e_Bv blogItem_textContainer__22V8N">
<p>After the war, all the papers except William Randolph Hearst&#8217;s <span class="edS-i">Journal</span> and Joseph Pulitzer&#8217;s <span class="edS-i">World</span> lowered the price to 50 cents a bundle. By the summer of 1899, newsboys were barely subsisting. On average, they earned only <a href="http://www.nypl.org/blog/2012/05/25/extra-extra-read-all-about-newsboys-strike-1899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">26 cents a day</a> working long hours. So the newsboys decided to strike to protest the costly papers.</p>

<h2>The Boys Formed A Union And Timed Their Strike To Avoid Cops</h2>

Consequently, they tipped the man&#8217;s wagon and stole his papers. This action triggered a larger strike, as the newsboys demanded a rollback to 1898 prices. The next day, the Manhattan newsboys created a union and announced they were on strike.</p>
<p>The newsboys chose the perfect moment to strike; the Brooklyn streetcar drivers were also on strike that week. Thus, according to an 11-year-old newsboy, &#8220;De cops is all busy!&#8221;</p>

<p>The July 1899 strike significantly disrupted New York&#8217;s newspaper business.

<p>The newspapers depended on underpaid child laborers to distribute their papers. The newspaper tycoons immediately felt the results &#8211; at the <span class="edS-i">World</span>, the paper slashed their press run from 360,000 papers a day to 125,000 a day. The stunned editor said, &#8220;It is remarkable the success these boys have had.&#8221;</p>

At least 5,000 newsies gathered to attack the tycoons. During a rousing speech, Kid Blink targeted the news tycoons directly:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t that 10 cents worth as much to us as it is to Hearst and Pulitzer, who are millionaires? Well, I guess it is. If they can&#8217;t spare it, how can we?

<p>The newsboys&#8217; strike stands out since children organized it. Despite their young age, the newsies were well-coordinated. They managed to cut circulation of the targeted papers by <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/childhood/modern-childhood-2013-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly two-thirds</a>, with a group of <a href="https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030272/1899-07-25/ed-1/seq-2/#words=newspaper+strike+Hearst+World&amp;date1=1836&amp;date1=01%2F01%2F1899&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;proxdistance=10&amp;state=New+York&amp;date2=1836&amp;date2=12%2F31%2F1899&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=newspaper+strike+&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=hearst+world&amp;dateFilterType=range&amp;index=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5,000 newsboys</a> meeting in Irving Hall to state their demands.

<p>The newsboys weren&#8217;t employees of the newspapers. Instead, they had to <a href="http://www.missedinhistory.com/podcasts/how-the-newsboy-strike-of-1899-worked-transcript.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy a bundle of papers wholesale</a> from a deliveryman, then sell the papers to profit. Before 1898, New York papers charged 50 cents for a bundle of 100 papers, which the newsboys sold for one cent per paper. However, if the newsies failed to sell the papers, they lost money. Newsboys worked long into the night to turn a profit.

<p>The outbreak of the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/spanish-american-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spanish-American War</a> in 1898 meant skyrocketing sales for US newspaper tycoons like William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, especially as the papers <a href="https://www.pbs.org/crucible/frames/_journalism.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sensationalized or sometimes manufactured</a> events to sell more copies.

<p>When newspaper sales returned to normal levels after the war, the <span class="edS-i">Journal</span> and <span class="edS-i">World</span> continued charging the higher fee, meaning newsies often had to sell papers well into the evening to make a living.</p>

<p>William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer were two of the wealthiest media moguls in the 20th century. The two battled each other for the top spot, with Hearst pulling ahead in 1897 when his two New York papers topped 1.5 million in circulation. Both tycoons relied on the newsboys to distribute their papers.</p>
<p>The strike proved the <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/childhood/modern-childhood-2013-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newsboys were indispensable</a>. Without them, the papers couldn&#8217;t make money, especially since home delivery had yet to exist, and there were only a few newsstands compared to many newsreaders. Once the tycoons realized the newsboys&#8217; power, they both agreed to negotiate.</p>

<p>The newsboys&#8217; strike of 1899 dragged on for the rest of July. In August, with their respective papers suffering from a massive drop in sales, William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer agreed to negotiate<a href="https://www.missedinhistory.com/podcasts/how-the-newsboy-strike-of-1899-worked-transcript.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> with the boys</a>. Initially, the newsies wanted a reduction in a bundle of 100 papers, which increased from 50 cents to 60 cents in 1898. But the negotiated victory turned out better than a price reduction.</p>
<p>The <span class="edS-i">World </span>and <span class="edS-i">Journal </span>agreed to a greater, unprecedented demand: the newsies could <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/story-newsies-strike-titans-pulitzer-hearst-article-1.2858550" target="_blank" rel="noopener">return</a><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/story-newsies-strike-titans-pulitzer-hearst-article-1.2858550" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> unsold papers</a> for a full refund. Instead of selling past midnight to make a profit, the boys could resell the papers back to the publishers, protecting themselves against a loss. The newsies agreed, and on August 2, 1899, they returned to selling papers.</p>

<p>How did an army of urchins beat two of the richest tycoons in the country? How could kids with names like Young Mush, Crutchie Morris, Kid Blink, and Racetrack Higgins take on the system and win? The newsboys benefited from three factors. First, the larger <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/story-newsies-strike-titans-pulitzer-hearst-article-1.2858550" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brooklyn streetcar strike</a> distracted the police. Secondly, the boys targeted the <a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/childhood/modern-childhood-2013-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weak point</a> in the newspapers&#8217; profits, which was distribution.</p>
<p>And finally, the boys understood the value of public relations. They encouraged supporters to buy rival papers &#8211; these dailies in turn <a href="https://www.nypl.org/blog/2012/05/25/extra-extra-read-all-about-newsboys-strike-1899" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published flattering stories</a> about the strike. The newsboys vowed never to &#8220;soak a lady&#8221; and only resorted to targeted violence to decry the unjust ways of the press. They also appealed to the millions of customers whom they interacted with daily.</p>
<h2 class="Title_title__2aoq1">The Strike Brought Attention To Terrible Conditions For Child Workers</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175303" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-15.jpg" alt="" width="1300" height="941" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-15.jpg 1300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-15-300x217.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-15-1024x741.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/13-15-768x556.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1300px) 100vw, 1300px" /></p>
<p>The newsboys didn&#8217;t merely win the war against Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst; their strike brought attention to the plight of child workers as well. Many of the newsboys featured in articles about the strike were <a href="https://www.missedinhistory.com/podcasts/how-the-newsboy-strike-of-1899-worked-transcript.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poor or homeless</a>, and they often jumped trolley cars to cover more ground or stayed out late to sell papers.</p>
<p>Before the rise of child labor protections, children across the country worked in unsafe conditions to scrape together a few nickels and dimes. Less than a decade after the strike, photographer <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/behold/2013/10/17/lewis_hine_s_photos_of_children_selling_newspapers_on_view_at_the_international.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lewis Hine</a> took pictures of newsies and other young workers as part of the National Child Labor Committee&#8217;s effort to end child labor. Progressives pushed for restrictions on child labor, successfully raising the nation&#8217;s working-age during the <a href="http://www.eiu.edu/eiutps/newsletter_childlabor.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Great Depression</a>.</p>
