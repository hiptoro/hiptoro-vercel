			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One thing that is surely complicated is biology. Otherwise, how can a surrogate mom become pregnant with her own child while carrying a couple’s baby? While this news is confusing for us, it’s a serious experience for the surrogate mom. </span></p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">After welcoming two healthy boys into her life, 31-year-old Jessica Allen decided to offer her services as a surrogate.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164357" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1-8.jpg" alt="" width="784" height="1044" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1-8.jpg 784w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1-8-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1-8-769x1024.jpg 769w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1-8-768x1023.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px" /></p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">Alongside this immediate benefit, Allen saw this move as an opportunity to give a family a chance to bring children of their own into this world.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164359" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2-9.jpg" alt="" width="1045" height="779" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2-9.jpg 1045w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2-9-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2-9-1024x763.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2-9-768x573.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1045px) 100vw, 1045px" /></p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">And so, Allen signed up with a San Diego-based firm called Omega Family Global and was matched with a Chinese couple in 2016.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164361" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-8.jpg" alt="" width="1044" height="894" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-8.jpg 1044w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-8-300x257.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-8-1024x877.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-8-768x658.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1044px) 100vw, 1044px" /></p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">In her words, &#8220;I was a bit scared, but I heard the Lius were thrilled to be having twins.&#8221;</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164363" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4-7.jpg" alt="" width="782" height="1041" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4-7.jpg 782w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4-7-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4-7-769x1024.jpg 769w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4-7-768x1022.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px" /></p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">And since Allen didn&#8217;t get the chance to see either baby after she gave birth to both of them via Cesarean section, she saw no reason to believe she wasn&#8217;t having twins.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164365" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-8.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="777" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-8.jpg 1200w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-8-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-8-1024x663.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-8-768x497.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-8-540x350.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p>As she put it, &#8220;I did notice that one was much lighter than the other. You know, obviously, they were not identical twins.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">To solve the mystery, this woman had the children take a DNA test.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164367" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6-9.jpg" alt="" width="781" height="1041" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6-9.jpg 781w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6-9-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6-9-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 781px) 100vw, 781px" /></p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">But Allen&#8217;s case was even rarer than that might suggest as this happened as a result of an incredibly uncommon phenomenon known as superfetation.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164369" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-9.jpg" alt="" width="761" height="601" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-9.jpg 761w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-9-300x237.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px" /></p>
<p>This is a term given for when a woman is pregnant with two babies who aren&#8217;t twins at the same time and according to their chief medical contributor — Dr. Jennifer Ashton — there still isn&#8217;t a solid hormonal or physiological explanation for why it happens.</p>
<p>A reproductive medicine specialist named Karen Boyle also said that there were only 10 previously reported cases of superfetation ever occurring.</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">But while Allen&#8217;s case is a marvel to those hearing about it, it soon turned into a nightmare for her.</h2>

<div class="text-content text" data-v-28b10e58="">
<p>As she said, &#8220;I was heartbroken knowing I carried a baby I didn&#8217;t know was mine and that he was taken from me without my knowledge and was in the arms of other people where he did not belong.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">Although the couple would end up giving the baby up to Omega Family Global, they wanted $22,000 in compensation and the agency wanted an additional $7,000 for expenses.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164375" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9-8.jpg" alt="" width="709" height="442" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9-8.jpg 709w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9-8-300x187.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" /></p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">By February 5, Allen would be reunited with her baby in a Starbucks parking lot and she and Jasper would eventually name him Malachi.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164379" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10-6.jpg" alt="" width="785" height="980" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10-6.jpg 785w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10-6-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10-6-768x959.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /></p>
<p>As she told the BBC, &#8220;When she [the case worker] pulled him out of her car and walked towards me, I just snatched him from her and said &#8216;give me my baby&#8217; and I was just kissing him and trying to look at his face for the first time. I sat in the back seat with him so I could see him and talk to him and stuff.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">10 months after this meeting, Allen and Jasper now say Malachi completes their family.</h2>
