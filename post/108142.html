			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever seen a dog and thought it to be of a breed but it turned out that it was of a totally different breed? Sadly, you are not alone. There are so many people who get confused when they see two similar dogs of different breeds. Actually it should not be surprising because there are more than 200 dog breeds. So it&#8217;s quite possible to spot dogs that are different but look like siblings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the look-alike dogs are only similar in their appearance because in most cases, these doggo doppelgangers have a totally different nature, habits, and other characteristics. To show you this thing, we have collected the pictures of 11 pairs of dogs that are confusing us more than anything else. </span></p>
<h2>1. St. Bernard and Moscow Watchdog</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-108149 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-118.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="536" /></p>
<p><strong>How you can tell them apart:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">St. Bernards are working dogs and they have a snub nose. Also, this dog breed has a little flattened face with folds. Meanwhile, Moscow Watchdogs are comparatively smaller with elongated bodies. Also, their nose is straight and they don’t have folds on cheeks.</span></p>
<h2>2. Pekingese and Japanese Chin</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-108150 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-112.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="402" /></p>
<p><strong>How you can tell them apart:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To differentiate between these two, you can just look at their face. A Pekingese has a flat and bigger face. On the other hand, a Japanese Chin has a slightly round forehead. </span></p>
<h2>3. Golden Retriever and Labrador Retriever</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-108152 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-112.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="491" /></p>
<p><strong>How you can tell them apart:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Golden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers look almost the same and you can get confused very easily. But remember that a Golden Retriever has bigger ears and a long &amp; wavy coat. Whereas a Labrador Retriever is bulkier in shape with short &amp; dense fur.</span></p>
<h2>4. Malamute and Siberian Husky</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-108153 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4-117.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="642" /></p>
<p><strong>How you can tell them apart:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you will see an Alaskan Malamute and a Siberian Husky, just like the rest of us, you might also think that they are the same. But they are not. It&#8217;s because Alaskan Malamute is larger, with a bulky head, and wide set-apart ears. However, a Siberian Husky has thin legs and a tail that is curled down.</span></p>
<h2>5. Russian Toy Terrier and Prague Ratter</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-108155 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-110.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="604" /></p>
<p><strong>How you can tell them apart:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, these two doggos look super cute but they are different. It&#8217;s because a Russian Toy Terrier has a pointed face with triangular ears. But a Prague Ratter has a muscular and longer body.</span></p>
<h2>6. Rough Collie and Sheltie</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-108156 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-106.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="622" /></p>
<p><strong>How you can tell them apart:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to know whether the dog is Rough Collie or Sheltie, just look at the face. A Rough Collie will have a longer and narrower face. Also, it is taller and bigger. On the other hand, a Sheltie has a shorter and wider head.</span></p>
<h2>7. French Bulldog and Boston Terrier</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-108158 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/7-105.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="525" /></p>
<p><strong>How you can tell them apart:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To differentiate between a French Bulldog and a Boston Terrier, just remember a few things. See, a French Bulldog is more stocky, shorter, and squat. While a Boston Terrier has elongated and thin paws.</span></p>
<h2>8. Bernese Mountain Dog and Australian Shepherd</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-108160 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/8-105.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="462" /></p>
<p><strong>How you can tell them apart:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Bernese Mountain Dog has a wide and rounded forehead. They also have a massive and large head. While an Australian Shepherd is smaller and has a waterproof coat.</span></p>
<h2>9. Pit Bull and Staffordshire Terrier</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-108161 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9-105.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="597" /></p>
<p><strong>How you can tell them apart:</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always remember that an American Pit Bull Terrier has shorter legs. While an American Staffordshire Terrier has big and long legs with a wider chest.</span></p>
<h2>10. Cocker Spaniel and Irish Setter</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-108162 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/10-104.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="491" /></p>
