			<p>Salma Hayek- 53-year-old, Mexican and American film actress and a successful producer as well. Despite the fact that she is in her 50’s it seems like her juvenile is gaining with time.</p>
<p>Hayek started her journey in Mexico with her debut in El Callejon de Los Milagros then slowly moved towards her Hollywood dream. She became famous from her film Desperado which was aired in the year 1995.</p>
<p>In this busy glamorous world, many are attempting to redress the balance and provide a much-needed dose of reality on social media. Similar to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/grombre/?hl=en">Grombre</a> movement. Which encourages people to embrace their grey hair and positivity in their body positivity.</p>

<p>Similarly, many celebrities are also trying to involve in being a more realistic representation of life. As opposed to a perfectly filtered part-reality that purports to be perfect.</p>
<p>Recently, actress Salma and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CBbA2Ucpcet/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">captioned her post</a> sharing with her fans a makeup-free, no-filter selfie &#8211; &#8220;<span class="">#selfiesunday #nofilter #nature&#8221;. And fans were stunned by her fresh-faced appearance.</span></p>
<h3>Most Beautiful Woman on the planet</h3>

<p>Following this, another wrote</p>

<p>The actress never dyes her hair. She enjoys being in the present. “It’s my natural color, and it’s my natural white hairs,” she said to the interviewer.</p>

<p>Salma Hayek has spoken candidly about her relationship with her body image in the past. In an interview with Harper&#8217;s Bazaar way back in 2016, she confirms that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I am entering my fifties so your body confidence isn’t that good. I think it depends on the day, for everybody, there’s some days you say, ‘This is it,’ and you love it. Then there are days when you go, ‘This can not be it! Is this really it?’ So I think it’s up and down all the time!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
