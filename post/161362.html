			<p>When you see someone in a space for a long time, you start to develop a liking for the person. Negão, a senior stray dog from Brazil and he were found loitering around an under-construction gas station.</p>
<p>Although he was an abandoned stray dog, his love and persistence landed him at his full-time home and job at the gas station.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you ever visit the Shell gas station in the town of Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil, you would be lucky enough to get a service from him.</p>

<p>A few years ago, Sabrina Planner and his partner decided to purchase the Shell gas while it was under construction. During their visit to the area, the couple noticed a senior dog wandering around the gas station. So, they decided to enquire about how long it has been for the dog to be in such a condition. Soon, they learnt that the dog had been dumped by his former owner, and so the couple decided to adopt him.</p>

<p>The couple took care of the dog and brought him some food, his bed and got him vaccinated.</p>
