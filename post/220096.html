			Donald Trump's Announces $99 Digital Trading Cards in His Likeness

			<p>On Thursday, former President Donald Trump shared a website where he sells a set of what he calls &#8220;digital trading cards&#8221; for $99 each. This is part of a new business he is starting to sell non-traditional currencies.</p>
<p>On a website called CollectTrumpCards.com, the 45th president is selling a series of artworks that show him as a superhero with laser eyes, an astronaut, a cowboy like John Wayne, and, of course, a dark-suited Trump surrounded by gold bars and one of him golfing.</p>
<p>In a video made for the launch, President Trump says that they are &#8220;just like a baseball card or other collectibles.&#8221;</p>
<p>After teasing a &#8220;major announcement&#8221; on his Truth Social platform the day before, President Trump finally said that the information would be released on Thursday morning, as he had said he would do the day before. Fans and people who don&#8217;t like him thought he might pick a running mate for his third run for president or even drop out since he&#8217;s not doing well in the early polls. This happened because the post was put up.</p>
<p>But it turned out that it was the businessman&#8217;s last attempt to make money.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>NFTs, which are also called &#8220;non-fungible tokens,&#8221; are pieces of data that are stored on a blockchain, which is a type of digital ledger. This information shows that a certain digital asset is unique and can&#8217;t be swapped for another.</p>
<p>In 2017, a new way for artists to get paid for their digital art changed the art market by making it more accessible and less expensive. During this pandemic, the number of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has exploded. It&#8217;s not surprising that the prices of NFTs made by famous artists have gone through the roof. The digital arts Pak&#8217;s &#8220;The Merge&#8221; was sold to 28,983 people for a total of $91.8 million a year ago, according to a source.</p>
<p>But Trump&#8217;s launch of the NFT comes at a time when the market for NFTs is stuck. Since the beginning of the year, the prices of NFTs have dropped by 97%. He promises that the purchasers</p>
<blockquote><p>will join a very exclusive community, my community, that I think it’s something you’re going to like and you’re gonna like it a lot.</p></blockquote>
<h6></h6>
<p>At the beginning of the video, Donald Trump talks to the audience and tells them that he hopes to be their favorite president of all time, even better than Lincoln or Washington.</p>
<p>The sales launch includes a &#8220;sweepstakes&#8221; with prizes like dinner with Trump, a group cocktail hour at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, a one-on-one meeting with the former president, and a round of golf. A dinner with the former president and a one-on-one meeting with Trump are also prizes. Trump is also giving people the chance to win prizes like one-on-one and group Zoom sessions with him, signed items, and &#8220;Golden Edition signed e-trading cards.&#8221;</p>
<p>The website says that fans who buy 45 digital trading cards, which would cost $4,455 before taxes and fees, are &#8220;guaranteed a ticket to a gala dinner with Trump in South Florida.&#8221;</p>
<p>Users can pay for things on the website with credit cards or cryptocurrencies, and it says that buyers can sell or trade their digital trading cards on any market that works with Polygon-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember, Christmas is coming, and this makes a great Christmas gift,</p></blockquote>
<p>the 45th president said in a video accompanying the launch.</p>
