			<p>Over time, people change, for better or for worse. The thing that we are doing today might get outdated in the coming years. For instance, kids earlier enjoyed playing outside. But these days, they are nowhere to be seen playing out of the house.</p>
<p>But do you know what has resulted in this shift? What has caused this change in behavior?</p>
<p>Well, this post highlights the main reason behind this change.</p>
<h2>Ever noticed how kids playing outside seems like a rarer occasion nowadays?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-191287" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-53.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="296" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-53.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-53-300x127.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>We don’t really see kids playing outside in the younger generations. Seemingly. And then we begin assuming how this is a result of things like the internet and social media. But</p>
<p>then the internet (well, Tumblr, actually) points out that there’s a whole different underlying reason behind it that makes everyone stop for a moment and rethink the younger generation’s social life.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-191288" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2-48.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="465" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2-48.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2-48-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>So, it all started with a tweet by architect Mitchell Jorstad, who wittily captioned a picture of a kid walking down the median strip of a busy street—if you can even call it a median as it’s also effectively in use and that means there ain’t much space to walk on.</p>
<p>The tweet read “older folks: ‘why don’t kids go outside anymore?’“, and a very appropriate caption “the outside they built:” followed with the above mentioned picture.</p>
<h2>A tweet wittily pointing this out went viral and found itself on Tumblr where people discussed it in detail</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/3-60d0a45cb089f__700.jpg" alt="Nearly 200K People Are Here For This Thread Explaining Why We Don’t See Kids Playing Outside As Often As We Used To" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-191289" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3-50.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="588" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3-50.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/3-50-300x252.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>And while this is a pretty clever way of bringing the point across, it didn’t stop there as the tweet—besides blowing up on Twitter—also found its way into a now-viral Tumblr thread that elaborated on the whole ‘why can’t I see kids playing’ issue one step at a time.</p>
<p>This led to a string of explanations of how we got to this point, with user <i>enchantingcoffeenightmare</i> first sharing a screencap of a Facebook post that briefly sums up how everywhere became either forbidden, eliminated or simply too much of a luxury for kids to hang out there.</p>
<h2>Most agreed that being outside for kids became a bit of a ‘social taboo’ because grown ups ruined it</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-191290" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/4-49.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="473" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/4-49.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/4-49-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-191291" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/5-51.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="787" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/5-51.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/5-51-267x300.jpg 267w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Then there was the story by binch-worm how she was homeless as a kid and would often spend countless hours in the library reading books, until someone caught on and demanded that she and her brother quit “loitering” there, so they were eventually limited to an hour per day. Homeless kids, quietly reading the whole day just to avoid the cold outside. Loitering. <i>[sigh]</i></p>
<h2>But among the discussions, one explanation came out as the definitive reason for why this is a thing</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-191292" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/6-51.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="474" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/6-51.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/6-51-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Anywho, some pictures, comics, and comments later, a user by the nickname of <i>tacofrend</i> said academics have already considered the issue of how just existing in public places is sometimes reacted to with hostility and punishment, pointing to author Gretchen McCulloch, who said they actually want to spend time outside doing social things, but they can’t because there isn’t a place to exist without being scrutinized for it.</p>
<h2>This one writer explained that kids <em>want</em> to go outside, just that many public places became ‘hostile’</h2>

<p>Kids want to hang out with friends outside and in person, but these are made difficult because of things like suburban isolation, mall ‘hostility,’ and things like borderline overbooked schedules full of extracurricular activities that don’t really allow true freedom of having fun.</p>
<p>And this isn’t indicative of what they’ll be doing in a decade as the previous generation used to spend hours on phones and in malls and whatnot, but they eventually became adults who got more freedom to do things without parental permission—and this was the key.</p>

<p>The reason why they prefer online is that meeting someone physically entails less freedom, more “scheduling,” control and surveillance from parents or guardians so as to keep them safe (this is further explained in her citation of the book that elaborated on it). Whereas online, where there are no parents and any of the above, it’s more fun. <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-191302" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/16-42.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="339" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/16-42.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/16-42-300x145.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>

<p>What do you think is the major reason that we don&#8217;t see kids playing outside anymore. Does your child involves in outdoor activities or not?</p>
