			<p>Once again, Dick Van Dyke has shown why his fans all over the world love him so much.</p>
<p>The actor who played in Mary Poppins is now 96 years old. For the past 80 years, he has worked to make people happy, and he has no plans to stop doing that any time soon.</p>
<p>A Hollywood legend was recently spotted making a purchase at a store in Malibu, where he reportedly bought a number of red plaid winter coats, according to the Daily Mail. After that, someone saw him giving these coats to a local charity.</p>
<p>Dyke has won Grammy, Tony, and Emmy awards, but he was seen pushing a shopping cart full of coats to his Lexus and loading them in. After that, he took the donated items to the charity organization himself.</p>

<p>On Twitter, Van Dyke&#8217;s fans were quick to praise him for his kindness, and one person even called him a &#8220;national treasure&#8221; because of it.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, the star of &#8220;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&#8221; was photographed giving cash to people in need while they waited at the Malibu Community Labor Exchange in Malibu, California.</p>
<p><strong>People</strong> says that the actor also tried to talk to both the people who worked at the employment center and the people who were looking for work.</p>
<p>A report in the Daily Mail says that the famous person told the photographer: &#8220;Whenever I have some fives I come by. You can&#8217;t do it all the time, though!&#8221;</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s clear that the actor&#8217;s good deeds have meant a lot to the people who work at the Malibu Community Labor Exchange. One of the workers there has even called Van Dyke &#8220;an angel from God.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;community-created nonprofit organization&#8221; was started in 1993, according to the MCLE&#8217;s website. On the website, it also says that the MCLE &#8220;provides a safe and organized place for people in Malibu to hire and be hired, giving unemployed people a chance to gain independence and self-sufficiency through work.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the month of June, Van Dyke was out running errands when he was overheard telling well-wishers that he is &#8220;just glad to still be here.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview with Closer Weekly, the actor who was in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang talked about how he stays healthy and active as he gets older. He told them that he still works out three times a week.</p>
<p>&#8220;I‚Äôve always been an exerciser and still am ‚Ä¶ I get in the pool and exercise. At my age, they say to keep moving. Put me on solid ground and I‚Äôll start tapping,&#8221; he told the outlet in 2009.</p>
