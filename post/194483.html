			<p>Its common for the woman living in this society to get questioned about their actions. But is it right? Is correct to invade someone&#8217;s personal life just for the sake of proving a point? Of course, not. That&#8217;s why celebrities these days are keeping their private life away from social media.</p>
<p>For example, take Cameron Diaz who had a great acting career starting in her early 20s. While she enjoyed traveling and working, it wasn’t until decades later that she realized what was really most important to her in life.</p>

<div class="entry-content-inner">
<p>Diaz is now 49 years old. She is married and the mom of a little girl named Raddix Madden. She and her husband, Benji Madden, have decided to keep their lives private and not to share pictures of their daughter on social media, but they did share a post announcing the birth of their daughter. No picture, but they claim she is “really really cute.”</p>
<p>Diaz’s daughter was born when she was 47 years old, which is an age when many women would think it was no longer possible for them to have children. According to sources close to Diaz, she and Madden tried to have a child for a long time before their daughter was born.</p>
<p>Since the birth of her daughter, Diaz has done a couple of interviews where she talks about what it’s like to be a mom and what it’s like to be a mom in her late 40s. She told Naomi Campbell, “I really feel like this is my sweet spot and my happiest time in my life….I know this is really the most gratifying moment in my life to be at this place, to get here…Having a family when you’re young…it’s like anything when you’re young. You do it…When you’re my age and you decide to do it, it’s a real choice…You really have to work hard for it.”</p>
<p>Although Diaz finds motherhood the “most gratifying moment,” she also explains that it still comes with its challenges. She’s well aware of the drawbacks of being an older mom. She explained, “A lot of people do it the other way around…They get married, they have a family in their youth. I’m kind of doing it in the second half of my life…The only pressure for me now is I have to live to be like 107.”</p>
<p>According to Diaz, in addition to listening to favorite baby songs like “Baby Shark,” her husband also writes songs for their daughter. She told Jimmy Fallon that the songs are “amazing. That’s what I sing all day in my head are his songs to her because she just loves it. She just looks at her daddy, and she just loves him so much. She thinks he’s the bee’s knees. It makes my heart just want to explode.”</p>
<p>Diaz also told Fallon that she understands what people mean when they say, “Really enjoy the time with your babies. It’s the best.” She explained that she sees her daughter changing every day, and while that makes it feel like she is already growing up too quickly, Diaz also finds it very rewarding. She said, “Yesterday is literally gone, and today is a new day, and tomorrow will be a new day that she’s a completely different baby. But it’s so gratifying to actually get to see that growth and to be a part of it and to help just let her be her, and it’s just amazing.” She added that parenthood is “the best thing that ever happened to both Benj and me. We’re so, we’re just so happy.”</p>
