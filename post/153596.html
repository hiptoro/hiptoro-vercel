			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As kids, we loved different movies that were actually cringey. While we didn&#8217;t realize this back then, we know it now. And we would never dare to watch these movies ever again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To know about movies that adults find cringey, which they once loved, people are answering the popular Reddit question- “What&#8217;s a movie you loved as a child that you now consider to be cringe-worthy?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">P.S. It totally depends on you whether or not you agree with this list. </span></p>

Blank check. The thought of being rich as a kid made me love the movie when I was younger. Watched it a couple years ago and got some real predator vibes between the kid and the lady FBI agent. Really hard to watch the ending where they kiss.</p>

Not even a kid, the 2002 movie Queen of the Damned. I was in my early 20s and thought it was so sexy and cool. I watch it now and it’s so campy and cringey and God bless Aaliyah but her performance was…eesh lol</p>

Any of the Mary Kate &amp; Ashley movies.</p>
<p>I’d like to make it clear that I grew up with these movies, loved the Olson twins, and there is a lot of nostalgia that comes with the memories of their movies. I just don’t think as an adult now they would be as great as I thought they were 20 some years ago.</p>

The Covenant. It was a relatively early Sebastian Stan movie that I was obsessed with in middle school. I rewatched it a few years ago and it is easily one of the worst acted movies I&#8217;ve watched. Definitely, the worst I&#8217;ve seen in a good decade. I really thought those guys were so cool. I just cringe thinking about how often I watched it and convinced myself that it was even halfway good just because there were hot guys.</p>
