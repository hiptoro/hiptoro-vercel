<h3>Sofia Explains the Chin Fat Removal Disaster</h3>
<p>Well, her swelled up face is just temporary. With God&#8217;s grace, she&#8217;ll not live her remainder life like this.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Lots of people have been asking why I made my face look like a rectangle. I didn&#8217;t purposefully make my face look like a rectangle. I got a treatment done called Kybella which removes fat from the lower part of your face. People tend to get it for your double chin but I got it in my jowls area,&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>She explained in another video that why her face is looking rectangular in shape. She further says &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Mine was really fatty covering up my jaw so I just wanted to remove that fat &#8211; just a little bit &#8211; just to make it look a little better. That&#8217;s all. It&#8217;s still really swollen and really numb.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sof.marroquin/">Sofia</a> knew that her face would swell after the treatment. But she didn&#8217;t know that it would be so bad. She is eagerly hoping for her swelling to go away as soon as possible.</p>
