			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t we like it when someone does something super special for our birthday? Surely we do. And we are not alone. Even Bailey, a 13-year-old senior dog, enjoys his birthday as much as we do. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, of course, he might have enjoyed many birthdays in his long life and is growing fast. But what remains constant is his love for his family. </span></p>
<h2>Meet Bailey, the senior doggo who just celebrated his 13th birthday &amp; was super excited about it</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101770 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1-82.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey’s family said that he turned 13 a few weeks back and was super excited about the surprise party. Now, this does not mean that Bailey has never got a birthday party. It&#8217;s just that every year he gets excited for his birthday just like the rest of us. </span></p>
<h2>Though the special day could have easily passed without much mention, his family felt that his big day was more than worth celebrating.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101771 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-80.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="918" /></p>
<h2>To mark the occasion, they gathered together to throw Bailey a party — much to the little dog’s surprise and delight.</h2>

<h2>For those wondering what Bailey got for his birthday (apart from the cake), it was a hot-dog chew toy, as seen in one of the photos included in this article. That smile says it all, folks!</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101773 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-4-82.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="873" /></p>
<h2>This was their way of showing their endless love and saying ‘thank you’ to Bailey for bringing them much joy</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101774 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-5-74.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="839" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bailey’s family loves him so much and just wanted to give him a little surprise for all the love and happiness that he has brought in their lives. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">His family wrote, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Happy 13th birthday to our boy BAILEY!” He brings us so much joy and we love him heaps!”</span></p>
