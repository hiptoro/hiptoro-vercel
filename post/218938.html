			<p>It seems like a long time ago that we first heard &#8220;Through the Wire&#8221; by Kanye West. 2004 was an easier year. Kanye was a great lyricist. It&#8217;s been almost twenty years since then. Ye is now writing Hitler fan fiction. The year is 2022. Ye would have been better off going off the grid and maybe detransitioning back into Kanye. He went on an Instagram rant instead. For a change, it&#8217;s not about Hitler. But he did say that Elon Musk is a Chinese hybrid who was made through genetic engineering and is the first of many Elons.</p>

<blockquote><p>AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS ELON COULD BE HALF CHINESE?</p></blockquote>
<p>Possibly.</p>
<blockquote><p>TAKE A CHINESE GENIUS AND MATE THEM WITH A SOUTH AFRICAN SUPER MODEL. AND WE HAVE AN ELON. I SAY AN ELON BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY MADE 10 TO 30 ELON’S AND HE’S THE FIRST GENETIC HYBRID THAT STUCK …. WELL LET’S NOT FORGET ABOUT OBAMA.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then he said he was sorry for &#8220;cursing in church,&#8221; but he still didn&#8217;t have &#8220;another word for Obama.&#8221; So&#8230; he was Obama as a swear word?</p>

<p>Now that Ye is going after the Chinese instead of the Jews, pretty sure there will be more calls for him to be punished. That would be one possible answer. Or, if you don&#8217;t want to, you can respond as Elon Prime did.</p>

<p>Honestly, it wouldn&#8217;t be an issue if Elon Prime was just one of many Elons. Like if Jamie Maddox, the Multiple Man, lived in real life. Musk can send one of his clones to Facebook to expose it in the same way that Elon Prime exposed Twitter. Then they could all go to Professor Xavier&#8217;s house for tea.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re almost certain that there is only one Elon Musk. And Ye might want to consider taking a nap.</p>
