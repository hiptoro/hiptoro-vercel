			<p>For a long time, Kirstie Alley was a friend and co-star of John Travolta.</p>
<p>True and Lillie Parker, the actress&#8217;s children, said on Monday that their mother had died after a private battle with cancer. She turned 71. Travolta, who worked with Alley in all three &#8220;Look Who&#8217;s Talking&#8221; movies and was a longtime friend, was one of the first to pay tribute to her on social media. Both of them believed in Scientology.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kirstie was one of the most special relationships I&#8217;ve ever had,</p></blockquote>
<p>he posted to Instagram shortly after her death was announced.</p>
<blockquote><p>I love you Kirstie. I know we will see each other again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alley became famous when she played Rebecca Howe on the TV show &#8220;Cheers.&#8221; For that role, she won an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe and was nominated for many other awards. She also starred in the shows &#8220;Veronica&#8217;s Closet&#8221; and &#8220;Fat Actress,&#8221; had her own reality show, &#8220;Kirstie Alley&#8217;s Big Life,&#8221; and competed on &#8220;Dancing with the Stars,&#8221; &#8220;Celebrity Big Brother,&#8221; and Season 7 of &#8220;The Masked Singer.&#8221;</p>
<p>She has also been in &#8220;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,&#8221; &#8220;Summer School,&#8221; the remake of &#8220;Village of the Damned&#8221; from 1995, &#8220;Drop Dead Gorgeous,&#8221; and &#8220;For Richer or Poorer.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>To all our friends, far and wide around the world &#8230; We are sad to inform you that our incredible, fierce and loving mother has passed away after a battle with cancer, only recently discovered,&#8221; her children shared in their announcement earlier this evening.</p>
<p>She was surrounded by her closest family and fought with great strength, leaving us with a certainty of her never-ending joy of living and whatever adventures lie ahead,</p></blockquote>
<p>the pair continued.</p>
<blockquote><p>As iconic as she was on screen, she was an even more amazing mother and grandmother.</p></blockquote>
<p>They also said they were &#8220;grateful for the care from the amazing team of doctors and nurses at the Moffitt Cancer Center.&#8221; Her children added that her</p>
<blockquote><p>zest and passion for life, her children, grandchildren and her many animals, not to mention her eternal joy of creating, were unparalleled and leave us inspired to live life to the fullest just as she did.</p>
<p>We thank you for your love and prayers and ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time,</p></blockquote>
<p>the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Alley and her ex-husband, Parker Stevenson, to whom she was married from 1983 to 1997, raised True and Lillie together. She was also married to Bob Alley for three years, from 1970 to 1977.</p>
