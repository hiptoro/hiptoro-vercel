<div class="wp-block-dx-block-dx-social-slide-block" data-block-number="1">
<p>And everyone was in love with how unique her bump was. Yep, that’s right… <em>was</em>, because the momma bear welcomed her triplets into the world on her 8th month of pregnancy via C-section, making her family of 4 a family of 7.</p>

<div class="wp-block-dx-block-dx-social-slide-block" data-block-number="2">
<p>And while they were all snug and warm, it’s safe to say that Michella was probably in quite a bit of discomfort.</p>

<p>“It feels as if the stomach has grown markedly during the night.⁣ It’s heavier and harder, and I’m getting harder and harder by breathing,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“I sweat profusely most of the time, have the wildest heartburn all day long, am constantly thirsty and hungry – but can not manage to eat at all, because I struggle to get air when I sit up.</p>
<p>“The belly now measures 136cm and is completely tense. I have started to lubricate it every other time I go to the toilet so that the skin does not hurt.⁣</p>
<p>“Fortunately, it is super effective. But of course, I am also constantly on the toilet,” she finished. She’s <em>definitely</em> a superhero.</p>

<p>But, it was a video of Michella holding her bump in her hands that garnered the attention of people on TikTok.</p>
<p>While 1 person wrote: “What agony,” another said: “God is wonderful, her face of happiness is the best. God give her a good birth…”</p>
<p>And even though many saw how beautiful the process of her pregnancy was, people still couldn’t get over the discomfort she must have felt, with another saying: “oh my god… what a pain…”</p>

<p>“And then we became three amazing babies richer,” she began.</p>

<p>“The birth went much better than feared – I got it bad along the way, but it was not nearly as bad as last time.⁣</p>
<p>“All that I will probably tell more about when we have found a routine.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, my postpartum pain and injuries are markedly worse than last! ⁣I’m in grotesque pain. And right now I can not see myself out of that nightmare… ⁣</p>

<p>“It has already become significantly smaller – but it is heavy and incredibly painful,” she wrote. But, even though she’s in a little bit of pain, she’s excited for her healing journey, adding that:</p>
<p>“It will be exciting and nerve-wracking to see how my body plans to heal.”</p>
