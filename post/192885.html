			<p>People don&#8217;t like to be bullied. There are always cruel kids who like to bully. They do it regardless of how many times they are told that it is not okay.</p>
<p>Something stands out to you if you were bullied a lot when you were younger. The people who did not bully you. The people who were nice to you. Those are the ones who get remembered.</p>
<p>Do you not believe us? A user with the handle @j_ryz recently shared a story about how he was introduced to his girlfriend by a person from high school who did not bully him.</p>
<p>The tweet said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúRan into a guy I played football with in high school today. As he‚Äôs introducing me to his GF he says, ‚ÄúThis is John he was the only popular kid in high school who didn‚Äôt bully me. He was actually my friend.‚Äù Just a reminder that people never forget how you make them feel.‚Äù</p>
<p>Everyone felt it. So much so that people began to share their stories with him. Those are hitting us as well.</p>
