Car crash dummies are built with a male standard, meaning that in car crashes, women are almost 50% more likely to be seriously injured than men.</p>

A lot of medicines are tested exclusively on men, so women end up getting prescribed doses that are way too much for them.</p>

Women are often misdiagnosed. They experience 50% higher rates of heart attack misdiagnosis, because they get fewer typical-symptoms, like subtle chest pressure or tightness in the chest, rather than the male presentation of full-blown chest pain.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a recent study that proves this fact:</p>

It&#8217;s considered totally normal for women to take birth control and deal with all of these side effects, but barely anyone ever talks about making birth control for men.</p>
<p>This study shows that male vs female contraceptives had almost identical side effects, yet male contraceptives were not fully developed due to these effects:</p>

Women often cannot comfortably reach the safety bars on metro subways.</p>

Speech-recognition software is 70% more likely to accurately recognize male voices. When Siri was released in the US, she could find prostitutes and Viagra suppliers, but not abortion providers. If you told her you&#8217;d been [sexually assaulted], she&#8217;d reply &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you mean by that&#8221;.</p>

CPR dummies are almost always male-bodied, so people who are trained in CPR often don&#8217;t know how to perform it properly on women. This was true until just recently a female CPR dummy was released. However, not many countries have those, and traditionally CPR is still being taught on male body manikins:</p>
