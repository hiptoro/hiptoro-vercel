			<p>It&#8217;s a sad day for everyone who likes DC. After Wonder Woman 3 with Gal Gadot was canceled, the Co-CEOs of the DC universe announced that Henry Cavill would not be in the new &#8220;Superman&#8221; movie. It looks like &#8220;Doomsday&#8221; is coming too soon for the DC universe because fans can&#8217;t accept the big changes that James Gunn and Peter Safran have made. Scroll down to find out more!</p>
<p>There was a lot of talk about how excited people were that Henry would be back as Superman. He had even told everyone about it a few months ago. Fans were excited to see their favorite actor put on the cape again, but it looks like the Co-CEOs don&#8217;t want that to happen.</p>
<p>James Gunn, the film&#8217;s director and co-CEO, took to Twitter to announce that they are writing a new Superman movie about his early life and that Henry Cavill will not be back to play the superhero. The Tweet said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Peter &amp; I have a DC slate ready to go, which we couldn’t be more over-the-moon about; we’ll be able to share some exciting information about our first projects at the beginning of the new year.</p></blockquote>
<p>James Gunn’s tweet further read,</p>
<blockquote><p>Among those on the slate is Superman. In the initial stages, our story will be focusing on an earlier part of Superman’s life, so the character will not be played by Henry Cavill. But we just had a great meeting with Henry and we’re big fans and we talked about a number of exciting possibilities to work together in the future.</p></blockquote>

<p>But a source close to the DC universe said that James Gunn and Peter Safran met with the actor Henry Cavill and came up with another role for him to play.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, Henry also posted on Instagram that he wouldn&#8217;t be coming back as Superman with the cape. The message he sent to his fans says,</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s sad news, everyone. I will, after all, not be returning as Superman. After being told by the studio to announce my return back in October, prior to their hire, this news isn’t the easiest, but that’s life,</p></blockquote>
<p>Cavill wrote.</p>
<blockquote><p>I respect that James and Peter have a universe to build. I wish them and all involved with the new universe the best of luck, and the happiest of fortunes.</p></blockquote>
