			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Have you ever thought of what happens to the dog at the rescue center that no one wants? Unfortunately, these doggos spend the rest of their lives hoping that someday, somebody will adopt them. It pains our hearts when we think of these innocent animal’s conditions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While everyone is busy picking the “perfect” doggo for themselves, Steve Greig, a 55-year-old man, drove to the nearest animal shelter to adopt ALL THE DOGS THAT NO ONE WANTED. Steve adopted these 9 dogs that are dealing with different health issues after his beloved doggo met an accident and lost his life.</span></p>

<h2>Say hello to Eyeore— the first dog Steve adopted after Wolfgang passed.</h2>

<blockquote><p><em>“It was just devastating. After a few months, I finally decided I needed something good to come out of his death. It was so immediately healing that I knew this is just what I was supposed to do. From then on, I only adopted senior dogs. I heard about another one that needed a home and then another one, and I just kept expanding.”</em></p></blockquote>
