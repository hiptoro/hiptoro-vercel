<h2>Rubin had learned that he had a newborn daughter in Arizona and he was being awarded custody.</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was going</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">back </span><span style="font-weight: 400">to his home</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">in Cleveland</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ohio after being awarded custody of his baby daughter</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></i></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14195930/dad6.jpg.webp" alt="" width="966" height="616" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He </span><span style="font-weight: 400">was worried and didn’t know what he must do with limited options and money. Then he </span><span style="font-weight: 400">remembered a volunteer, Joy Ringhofer, whom he had met at Banner Medical Center while his daughter was in the NICU.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<h2>Recently widowed, Joy recognized that Rubin was a doting father even though he had been thrust into a surprising situation.</h2>
<p>He has three grown children from a prior marriage and four step-children with Tiffany.</p>
<p>For some strange reason, Joy felt compelled to jot down her phone number and gave it to Rubin, which shocked him.</p>
<h2>She even offered to give him a ride to the airport on the day he was scheduled to leave.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14195703/dad1.jpg.webp" alt="" width="689" height="613" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ru-Andria wasn’t able to fly with Rubin because he needed to have her birth certificate. Frontier Airlines’ policy </span><span style="font-weight: 400">bars children less than seven days old from flying.</span></p>
<h2>But it would take up to a week to get the proper documentation!</h2>
<p>“I was out of money and the hospital told me that I wouldn’t be able to get a birth certificate for seven days. I was worried that if security saw me sleeping at the airport with a newborn, they’d take her away from me and charge me with neglect. I was stuck.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14200005/dad2.jpg.webp" alt="" width="527" height="607" /></p>
<p>He reached out to his wife Tiffany and she was at a loss.</p>
<h2>They just didn’t have the money for him to rent a car and drive home or reserve a hotel room and wait it out.</h2>
<p>“When he called me from the airport and told me that they weren’t going to let him fly until he could get a birth certificate in four days, I felt panicked … I didn’t want him to sleep at the airport. I was scared because it looked like we were out of options.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14200057/dad3.jpg.webp" alt="" width="434" height="496" /></p>
<p>Rubin thought of contacting Joy, the NICU volunteer who kindly gave him a ride to the airport and showed him nothing but compassion.</p>
<h2>He was out of options, so he took and chance and called the senior citizen.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/28065102/flight-sotry-4.jpg.webp" alt="" width="766" height="667" /></p>
<h2>He told her what had transpired and she insisted upon returning to the airport to pick up him and his darling daughter.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/28064449/flight-story-2.jpg.webp" alt="" width="653" height="565" /></p>
<p>“I told him, ‘I’m going to take you home with me,’ so wait right there. There are a lot of dangers out there, but there’s a lot of good, too. I’d enjoyed talking to Rubin at the hospital and helping him with the baby. He was polite and kind and I could tell that he had a good heart.”</p>
<h2>Rubin, a deli owner back in Ohio, could not believe Joy’s willingness to rescue him, a stranger, and Ru-Andria from their predicament.</h2>
<p>“I’m black and she is white. I’m a stranger who grew up in the projects in the Bronx and she’s a great-grandmother who recently lost her husband. She knew very little about me, and yet, she took me in. The color wasn’t an issue to her. She showed me that in this crazy world, there is still compassion.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14200152/dad4.jpg.webp" alt="" width="857" height="608" /></p>
<p>Rubin contacted his wife and explained that how Joy, his angel, had gone above and beyond to help him out.<br />
She, too, was surprised after hearing this. But Rubin didn’t hesitate to take Joy up on her offer, since he had a wonderful feeling about her the day he met her.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/28064857/flight-story-3.jpg.webp" alt="" width="878" height="658" /></p>
<p>“Miss Joy was like an angel and she’d really bonded with Ru-Andria. Whenever my daughter heard her voice, her face would light up. As soon as she took us in, I knew we’d be friends for life.”</p>
<p>The 43-year-old dad and the 78-year-old widowed cared for  Ru-Andria together.</p>
<p>Joy shared that, at the time, she had four children, seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://sbly-web-prod-shareably.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/14200234/dad5.jpg.webp" alt="" width="931" height="613" /></p>
<p>“I could see the pain in her face from losing her husband, so at the cemetery, as we sat there with the baby, I said, ‘Hey, Charles, look — it’s your new granddaughter.’ We had some touching and wonderful moments. I lost my mom to cancer in 2007, so Joy really became like a mother or grandmother figure to me.”</p>

<p>Finally, Rubin and Ru-Andria could move to their home as the birth certificate was ready.</p>
<p>But he knew he’d miss Joy. The two vowed to stay in touch and regularly visited via FaceTime, which fills Joy’s days with happiness.</p>
<p>“We just knew that we’d always be in touch from that day forward. We started out as strangers and ended up as good friends. Rubin is very grateful to me, but I’m also very grateful to have had the opportunity.”</p>
