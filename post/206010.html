			Jaguar Attacks Woman Who Broke the Rules, Zoo Decides Not to Euthanize the Animal

			<p>There have been many tragedies in zoos because of human mistakes. It&#8217;s easy to be amazed by the animals that we don&#8217;t see a lot. Taking selfies and group photos with animals is common. We should be aware of our surroundings when taking selfies.</p>
<p>Accidents can be caused by the carelessness of humans. There are zoo accidents that happen because of the lack of security measures. The animal is too fierce and aggressive to attack humans.</p>
<p>A woman in her 30s was attacked by a jaguar at the Wildlife World Zoo in Arizona.</p>
<p>The woman was trying to take a picture with her phone. She reached out to take a picture with the big cat. The woman was attacked by the jaguar out of the blue. She was taken to the hospital quickly and did not suffer life-threatening injuries.</p>
<p>The footage was taken by a man. He was at the zoo with his mother and two kids when a woman was attacked by a cat. The woman&#8217;s hand was grasped by the jaguar&#8217;s claws after he heard the scream. He recalled the incident on the internet. He wrote, “It seems like pandemonium. Everyone yelling for help. ”</p>
<p>The mother tried to distract the jaguar by throwing a water bottle. The woman&#8217;s hand was let go by the jaguar. He added, “We’re still in shock from it all. ”</p>
<p>The zoo was visited by Jeff Allan before. He told ABC15 that he had been a victim of the same jaguar. Allan said he reached over the barrier to take a video but the animal attacked him.</p>
<p>He said he had to get eight stitches. He hired an attorney to try and get the zoo to put barriers between the animals and visitors.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>The director of the Wildlife World Zoo said that the female jaguar had taken a jab at the zoo visitors before. He stated that the animal will not be euthanized. He said that it “was not the animal’s fault and they would never harm an animal, based on human behavior.”</p>
<p>Ollson added, “I think you observe the barriers – they are there for a good reason. ”</p>
<p>In a Tweet, the Wildlife World Zoo officials stated: “We can promise you nothing will happen to our jaguar. She’s a wild animal and there were proper barriers in place to keep our guests safe- not a wild animal’s fault when barriers are crossed. Still sending prayers to her and her family.”</p>
<p>What do you think about the zoo director? Do you think the animal should be put down for attacking people? The woman jumped the barriers.</p>
