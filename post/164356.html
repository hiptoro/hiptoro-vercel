<h2>Fact: Putting Paw On You</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164377" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2-10.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="485" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2-10.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2-10-300x208.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Whenever your dog puts their paw on you like this, it&#8217;s their way of showing that they love you and it&#8217;s their way of petting you.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Fact: Staring At You While They Do Their Business </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164381" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-9.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-9.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-9-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Your dog is staring at you while they poop because they trust you and think you&#8217;ll look out for them while they&#8217;re vulnerable while they&#8217;re doing their business.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Fact: Dogs Can Get Jealous </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164383" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4-8.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="662" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4-8.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4-8-300x284.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
On the flip side, dogs can feel jealousy. Any time you&#8217;re giving attention to another dog treats, petting, your dog can feel jealous.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Fact: They Know Your Routine </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164385" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-9.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-9.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-9-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Your dog actually knows your routine. If you have a pretty normal routine, your dog can tell when you&#8217;re coming home based on the amount of your scent left in the house.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Myth: 1 Human Year = 7 Dog Years </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164387" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6-10.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="869" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6-10.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6-10-242x300.jpg 242w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6-10-445x552.jpg 445w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
That 1 human year equals 7 dog years. The first year of a dog&#8217;s life is usually about 12 to 15 human years, the second is usually 9 to 10, and the rest after that are usually about 4 to 5. It depends on the dog&#8217;s weight, breed, and other things</p>
<h2 class="heading">Myth: Dogs Eat Grass When They&#8217;re Sick </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164389" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-10.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-10.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-10-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
That dogs eat grass because they&#8217;re sick. And while this can be true, a lot of dogs do this out of boredom or they just think it&#8217;s fun to eat grass.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Myth: Dogs See In Black &amp; White </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164391" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-9.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="432" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-9.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-9-300x185.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
That dogs see in black and white. Dogs lack some light receptors in their eyes to see colors, but they can see on a yellow-blue scale and this is what it would look like in their vision versus ours.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Fact: Scooting Their Butt </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164393" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9-9.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="495" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9-9.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9-9-300x212.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
When your dog is scootin&#8217; his butt across the floor like this, he&#8217;s not just trying to make you laugh. This is almost a sure sign of plugged or infected anal glands, which can collect fluid and can actually be drained manually, or they might be given something for it.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Myth: A Dog&#8217;s Mouth Is Cleaner Than A Humans </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164395" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10-7.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10-7.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10-7-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
That a dog&#8217;s mouth is cleaner than a human&#8217;s. And this myth started when dogs licked their wound, they were seen to heal quicker, but that wasn&#8217;t because they&#8217;re cleaner, it was because of the blood flow from licking it. So dogs&#8217; mouths are dirtier and this is probably why your vet tells you not to let your dog kiss your face.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Fact: Dogs Can&#8217;t Feel Guilty </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164397" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11-8.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11-8.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11-8-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11-8-438x246.jpg 438w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11-8-255x144.jpg 255w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11-8-350x198.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Even though your dog may look guilty, dogs cannot feel guilt.</p>
