<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A man who broke his neck outdoors in freezing conditions survived lying in the snow for nearly 24 hours thanks to his dog, who kept him warm through the night and barked for help. Anticipating a journey of only several meters, the man was wearing just long johns, a shirt, and slippers when he went outside, despite the temperature being around -4C. However, he slipped and broke his neck. Kelsey, a five-year-old Golden Retriever, kept him warm by lying on top of him and kept him awake by licking his hands and face</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our house caught fire at 2 am in November 2016. Our dog Molly woke us up. She saved the lives of 7 people, 2 dogs, and 4 cats. She was blind and given 2 months to live 4 months before the fire. 2 years later, and she is still alive and kicking. We take her to the vet weekly to get fluid drained from her lungs. She is still happy and wagging.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A woman saved a pit bull named TatorTot just hours before he was scheduled to be euthanized and less than a week later TatorTot returned the favor when he helped save her 4-year-old son. That night the pit bull began barking and running back and forth between the woman and her son. She thought that TatorTot just hadn’t exercised out all of his energy, but the pit bull wouldn’t give up until she finally went to check on her son. He was barely breathing, TatorTot was on his bed, barking and pawing at him, licking his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One late evening in May 2012, a freight train conductor riding in Shirley, Massachusetts saw the silhouette of a person and a dog on the tracks ahead. He radioed for the train to stop but could tell there wasn’t going to be enough time. Christine Spain had tripped on the tracks while walking her dog, Lilly, and fell unconscious. The conductor saw that the silhouette was moving — Lilly was attempting to pull her immobilized owner off the tracks. As the train passed over the pair, the conductor claims to have felt a thump. When he was able to safely exit the train, he found Spain unscathed; Lilly had covered her owner and took the hit for her. While waiting for emergency services, Lilly continued to watch over Spain, though the dog herself was suffering from extreme injuries, including to her front right leg, which had to be amputated in surgery.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 12, 2008, in La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina, a dog named China was honored with the Shining World Hero Award by Supreme Master Ching Hai, for her brave maternal love. On a frigid winter night, China found an abandoned baby girl in a field and carried her back to the pen that held her own newborn pups. Together with her pups, China kept the baby warm through the night until her human caretaker heard the cries of the infant and took her to the local hospital for medical attention. The baby was aptly named “Esperanza,” meaning hope, at the hospital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man was walking his dog who began behaving peculiarly, and he noticed the dog buried up to her head. Only her head was visible and it was difficult to see given the amount of earth covering her. She was surrounded by rocks and also she was attached to a large sack filled with gravel (to keep her from escaping). Thanks to a dog and owner who happened to see her head emerging from the ground the buried dog survived</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Our Hero Buster came into our lives when my husband started a job that required him to travel. I looked for a puppy and found the best friend ever. Soon after Buster came into our lives my husband became very sick. After multiple hospital stays and surgeries, he came home from the hospital. Buster was 10 months. My husband was sleeping downstairs in our living room, he was unable to use the stairs after his operation. Buster and I were sleeping upstairs, we were having a terrible ice storm that night. Buster woke me up barking. That wasn&#8217;t like him. He&#8217;s not a barker&#8230;I thought he may have heard a snowplow outside, but I realized he wasn&#8217;t barking at the window, but he was barking at the bedroom doorway. I decided since I was awake I would check on my husband. It was a good thing I did, when we got downstairs my husband was unconscious on the floor. He had gotten up and blacked out. He hit his face on a piece of furniture and cut his face. When I got him to the hospital his blood pressure was 55/30. The doctors said if I hadn&#8217;t found him when I did he very likely would have stroked out and possibly died&#8230;If it wasn&#8217;t for Buster I never would have gone down to check on my husband, I didn&#8217;t hear him fall but Buster did..My husband thanks Buster every day for saving his life.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 11:10 we could see the first of the flames across the valley. By 11:15 they were growing larger and the winds went mad. We had loaded up the dogs and cats, but Odin, our stubborn and fearless Great Pyrenees would not leave the goats. Even under the best of circumstances, it is nearly impossible to separate Odin from the goats after nightfall when he takes over the close watch from his sister Tessa. I made a decision to leave him, and I doubt I could have made him come with us if I tried. We got out with our lives and what was in our pockets. Cars behind us on Mark West Springs Road were pouring flames out of the windows as they roared down the road. Later that morning when we had outrun the fires I cried, sure that I had sentenced Odie to death, along with our precious family of bottle-raised goats. Today, we were able to make it back to the smoldering wasteland of our forest. Every structure is in ruins. Trees are still burning. Yet, eight goats came running to see us and get cuddles and kisses. Dixon has a burn on his back the size of a nickel. Other than that they are perfectly fine. Odin’s fur is burned and his whiskers melted. He is limping on his right leg. And he has adopted several baby deer who huddle around him for safety and water from their trough, which is miraculously intact and full of relatively clean water. We dropped off several bails of orchard grass and gave them fresh water. Tomorrow we hope to reunite them all with his sister Tessa. I’m sure Odin believes she has perished. I can’t wait to see their faces when they see each other. Odin has lived up to his namesake. Pray for him and his charges. He is our inspiration. If he can be so fearless in this maelstrom, surely so can we</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roselle had led Hingson through the noise, smoke, and rubble of the office to descend the stairway. Once on the ground level in the middle of the human panic Roselle remained focused as they continued walking away from the chaos. When they were about two blocks away, Tower 2 began to collapse. To escape the ash and debris, they started running for the subway. Roselle eventually guided Michael to the home of a friend in mid-Manhattan where they stayed until the trains were running again. They were finally able to arrive home in New Jersey after seven that night.</span></p>
