			<p>Pet owners share a special bond with their companions and can shower your sick sidekick with love and snuggles. But this dog fakes a cough to get the attention of his owner. It is when some smart pets completely figured that out this side of their owners.</p>
<p>This is a story of Sullivan &#8211; the one-and-a-half-year-old border collie mix. This story happened to be when “Sully” developed a mysterious cough one day a week ago back then. Well, it was found later that he&#8217;s fakes a cough. Longhurst was worried about the illness and sat back home for his pet. He wrote &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>“His cough started about a week ago. We try really hard to not leave him alone for more than three-four hours at a time. I was substitute teaching that day and came home for a quick lunch and some Sullivan cuddles. Right when I was about to leave back to the school, he started doing this really scary cough/clearing of throat/ choking noise. And it really freaked me out. I started frantically googling dog CPR and tried looking down his throat, all while he was acting completely normal. He was wagging his tail and running around and just wanted to play but also kept making this horrific noise. I called my husband freaking out and told him what was happening and that I needed to leave for work but didn’t want to leave him alone, so my husband rushed home to be with him.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Kennady Longhurst &amp; Alex Salsberry shared their original post on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lovewhatreallymatters/posts/1729172233771834">Facebook page</a>.</p>
<h3>After Visiting Vet She&#8217;s Totally Normal</h3>
<p>Soon after returning from the vet, strangely the pet stopped coughing. They continued saying that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>“He was completely fine through the afternoon, evening and nighttime. So, we figured he must have just gotten something stuck in his throat and finally got it out. Except, the next morning when we both started getting ready for work, he started doing it again. My husband decided he would work from home that day and take him to the vet that afternoon.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Starting to figure out what’s going on? Here’s a hint: The vet couldn’t find a single thing wrong with Sully. He was “the epitome of health,” Longhurst wrote. Also said &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>“We called around a few vets in our city and asked them for some ideas of what could have been happening. Almost all of them said he could be acting sick in the mornings or when we leave him because he knows. If he acts differently or sick we pay more attention to him and stay with him. The vets said it doesn’t happen a lot and that most of the time if your dog is acting sick they are, but a few really smart animals know how to use and abuse the system.”</p></blockquote>

<p>After they took Sully to the vet, he suddenly stopped faking his cough. They think the benefit of the added attention didn’t outweigh the trauma of a trip to the vet’s office. Meanwhile, the comments in the post are full of other dog owners who thought their genius pups belonged in doggy Mensa for their ability to fake being sick. Until they all saw this post, that is another&#8217;s pet also fakes a cough (or something similar). Now they know exactly how common this is.</p>

<p>One comment by Heather Fernweh that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="_5mur">My dog faked a leg injury for attention. He actually started limping in the wrong leg at the vet</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Following this Maribel Lopez says &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="_5mur">Marlo here fakes a leg injury every morning when the temp is below 60 degrees. He limps and refuses to go outside. He miraculously is healed when it warms up. Hes a big ole faker too.</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Not only to dogs but many other pets fakes illness to get attention from their owners. And I have a cat who once faked losing her voice just wanted to eat canned cat food instead of the dry stuff. She then behaves whole fine until it is time for dinner. And upon seeing kibbles in her bowl, she would suddenly develop a pathetic, raspy little meow.</p>
