			19 Black Families Decide To Build Their Own Safe City, Purchase 97 Acres Of Land In Georgia

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The world is not perfect but it is a better place to live in. However, the protest</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> over police brutality has left some black families think “are we really safe?”. Thus, 19 black families ended up buying 97 acres of land in Georgia to build their own safe city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ashley Scott, a Georgia-based realtor said that they are trying to build a place with like-minded people. The idea of doing something like this came when Ahmaud Arbery, a black man was killed by a group of white men while out on a jog.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-149206 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-213.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="420" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-213.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1-213-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>“I am concerned. At times distraught. For the first time ever in my life, I felt disempowered. So much so that the overachieving, solution-oriented, practical, non-emotional person that I am had to stop,” Scott wrote.</p>
<p>“I sought counseling from a black therapist and it helped. It helped me to realize that what we as black people are suffering from is racial trauma. We are dealing with systemic racism. We are dealing with deep-rooted issues that will require more than protesting in the streets. It will take for us as a people, as Atlanta rapper and activist Killer Mike so eloquently put, ‘To plot, plan, strategize, organize and mobilize.’ So that’s what I and my good friend Renee Walters, an entrepreneur and investor, did.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-149207 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-208.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="744" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-208.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2-208-282x300.jpg 282w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Together, they began to look for ways to change the world for the better in whatever way they could. “We wanted to make some kind of difference that could ensure the safety of our black sons and black husbands when they went about their lives just breathing and being. We wanted to do something to amass black power to affect real change.” <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-149208 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-205.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="546" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-205.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3-205-300x234.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>“That&#8217;s when we considered the reality that even in Atlanta, with an exceptional black woman like Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, there was still no respect for the humanity of blacks,” Scott continued. “Even with Erika Shields, a black woman chief of police at the helm, there was the murder of Rayshard Brooks. We can see there is something much deeper happening. Politics, as usual, isn’t the answer. Something new has to happen.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-149209 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/4-201.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="420" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/4-201.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/4-201-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>“It was clear to me that developing new cities was necessary because these old ones, even with strong black leadership, have too many deep-rooted problems.” <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-149210 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5-191.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="630" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5-191.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5-191-300x270.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>“At first, I attended wanting to get a few new clients, but seeing the progress of the newly created city of Stonecrest, Georgia, inspired me.”</p>
<p>It motivated Scott to look more deeply into local politics and how cities are created. “My research into cityhood gave me insight that this is how we change our communities and build real black power.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-149211 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/6-189.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/6-189.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/6-189-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/6-189-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/6-189-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>“Black power comes from wealth,” Scott explained. “Wealth is created through cash flow and assets. Who has more cash flow and assets than governments? Where does the cash flow come from? Taxes and bonds. Who pays taxes? Landowners. Who runs governments? People. We are the people and we have to be more involved, especially young people!”</p>

<p>“We figured we could try to fix a broken system or we could start fresh. Start a city that could be a shining example of being the change you want to see. We wanted to be more involved in creating the lives we really want for our black families. And maybe, just maybe, create some generational wealth for ourselves by investing in the land. Investing in creating a community that is built around our core values and beliefs.”</p>

<p>“We made a PowerPoint presentation the day after we left the ‘Toomsboro for Sale’ open house. Then we called our like-minded friends and family. We impressed upon them the urgent power of now. After that, we brought 19 families together on one accord during a series of online meetings. We started an LLC and considered a field and we bought it. We bought 96.71 acres of land!”</p>
