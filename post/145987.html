			<p>The tax that women have to pay on their products is comparatively higher than what men usually pay. The pink tax has existed for the longest time and shows how gender inequality exists in the smallest of things.</p>
<p>Recently, a 7-year-old girl had her first experience with such a things while she was playing Animal Crossing on Nintendo Switch. The child was confused that why her dress costed more than the outfit of her brother.  Ashley, the author of the mindful parenting blog “<a href="https://www.raisingbrain.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Raising Brain,</a>” and mother of the child had no answer to her questions.</p>
<p>For a 7-year-old, it was a big step to take matters in her hand. She decided to write a letter to the megacorporation to address the problem.</p>
<h2>Frustrated by how much more the princess dress cost than a boys’ outfit, the 7-year-old girl pens a letter to Nintendo</h2>

<p>We wanted to know more about the whole store, so we reached out Ashley Bobst.  She told us that “Oakley is a very strong-minded young lady who is very aware and empathetic to the social issues we share with her and allow her exposure to. She has a keen eye for injustice and isn’t afraid to point it out, as my husband and I are very outspoken about things that we see as not being right.”</p>
<p>“As parents we tend to take the Socratic approach when they ask about something that they don’t think is right and instead of influencing their view points, we ask them questions such as, ‘Do you think this is fair, why or why not?’ and then we always ask ‘What would you like to do about this?’”</p>
<h2>Mom Ashley, who is the author of a mindful parenting blog, shared the story on her Facebook where it resonated with many people</h2>

<p>Mom Ashley, who’s a nurse by trade, said she’s “fortunate to be able to stay home and homeschool my two children, 9 and 7. I volunteer from home on my own to help connect people in our community with resources via Facebook community pages and working with our local Social Services Department and Food Pantries. My children see me doing this, and naturally inquire as to how they can help.”</p>
<p>Ashley feels that “giving them the opportunity to live in and be involved in our society naturally from a young age will provide them with an education unlike any institutionalized environment.” She’s also “a firm believer of behavioral modeling when setting the foundation for communication and education; children will naturally follow a trusted person’s lead.”</p>
<p>We were curious to know more about the pink tax, so we decided to reach out to Angie, the founder and owner of “<a href="https://mybluetax.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Blue Tax Body + Care.</a></p>
<h2>And here’s the letter this little girl wrote to Nintendo</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-146073 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10-73.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="714" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10-73.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/10-73-294x300.jpg 294w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>She mentioned that the pink tax is a big problem “for any woman who doesn’t want to pay an extra $1351 on average for products she uses that are comparable to similar men’s products. And it is a big problem for any man who believes in equal rights for women.”</p>
<p>Yet, “the problem becomes even bigger when you consider that women are still paid, on average, $.82 for every $1.00 men make. Women make less money and pay more at the register. That’s a big problem if we want to live in an equitable society,” Angie explained. <img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-146080 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/11-70.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/11-70.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/11-70-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/11-70-438x246.jpg 438w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/11-70-255x144.jpg 255w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/11-70-350x198.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>She further added, “Companies charge more for women’s products because they are getting away with it and it increases their profits. Most people aren’t aware that the pink tax exists, but once you start looking for it, you will find it everywhere, from cradle to grave: pacifiers, toys, school supplies, personal care products, nonprescription medicines, and the list goes on and on. And that is just considering the classic pink tax.”</p>
