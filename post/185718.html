<p>We have curated this list of those glorious moments when people had tons of fun at museums. Have a scroll and stroll down our digital gallery and remember to touch the art as much as you’d like. Oh, and if you have a favorite museum, why not let us know all about it in the comments?</p>

<p>One way to spread awareness and interest in art and history is through memes on social media. One successful example of this is the ‘Classical Damn’ Instagram account. Bored Panda recently spoke to the founder of the project who found a lot of success when they mixed classical paintings with modern captions.</p>
<p>In short, the memes made classical art very relatable because they touched on topics that we all care about. From relationships and coronavirus to politics and religion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even though the paintings are hundreds of years old, their expressions and captions make it seem they are one of us,&#8221; they told Bored Panda.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my opinion, art and art history can be made more accessible by increasing public access to art spaces. Instagram has done a tremendous job in this by providing a platform to artists, content creators, and curators,&#8221; the creator of &#8216;Classical Damn&#8217; said.</p>

<p>&#8220;More and more people have started appreciating art after seeing them on their feeds and then trying to learn more about their backgrounds. Technology has made its interpretation and access inclusive. The future is going to be an exciting period for art and I&#8217;m looking forward to it,” they shared their thoughts.</p>
<p>However, former art gallery director Shelby Bercume from Florida disagrees that art and history aren’t approachable. She sees art as an intrinsic part of our daily lives.</p>

<p>&#8220;You literally cannot turn around without seeing some form of art, in architecture, logos, billboards, television, everything. And that came from somewhere,&#8221; she said that, from her perspective, the idea that art is unapproachable is archaic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything is cyclical. We develop new styles that hold qualities of the old while still addressing and innovating in the now. So do I think there will be an exact regurgitation of the older movements? No. But I do think we can see common themes from what once was,&#8221; Shelby mused about whether or not we’ll see a renaissance of classical art.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t think I could pick one movement that would be my favorite, but I am very fond of the Rococo movement. I love the frivolousness and whimsey of it. It was idealistic and excessive and a bit of an absurd expression of a carefree lifestyle,&#8221; the art history expert told Bored Panda.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don’t care for one style of art, there are plenty others to choose from. I have never really understood why there is such a block. Art is what you make of it, if you don’t like &#8216;x,&#8217; move on to &#8216;y.&#8217; And if you really want to understand something, do your research and dive into it. Figure out what the beginnings were. What is the artist trying to say? Are they trying to say anything? Is it for aesthetics? Are you supposed to interpret it or are you looking too far into it? You don’t have to understand everything to like it, and you don’t have to like everything to appreciate it. If you can’t get past disliking a particular movement, you can find another one.&#8221;</p>
