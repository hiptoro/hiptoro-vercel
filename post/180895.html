			<p>The holiday season costs a lot. There are holiday parties, gift exchanges, and pictures with Santa. Eggnog and the ingredients for your famous Christmas cookies are not free.</p>
<p>If you are spending the day with family and friends, your wallet can breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of work to prepare a large family dinner for a holiday like Thanksgiving or Christmas. All that food can get pretty expensive if you save yourself some work in the kitchen and cater for the gathering.</p>
<p>When families share a meal, one carries a loaf of bread and the other a bottle of wine. However, one woman, in particular, uses a different approach that the son and her daughter-in-law are completely unaware of.</p>

<p>One lady posted on a forum called Mumsnet that she&#8217;s going to go to her parents for Christmas lunch, and her boyfriend was planning to go to his parent&#8217;s house for Christmas lunch but is having second thoughts because his mom wants to charge him $21 for his portion of the meal. He feels like he wants to come to my family now that she said she doesn&#8217;t want to do it all from scratch and wants to get it all pre-done so it&#8217;s more money. It is hard work and can be expensive but not like she is penniless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What the viewers had to say.</h2>
<p>The discussion board had mixed reactions.</p>
<p>Some commenters think that the request is completely reasonable. One person commented that it&#8217;s really expensive to cater a Christmas dinner for a lot of people.</p>
<p>A lot of people think the request to pay for Christmas dinner is ridiculous. One person commented that they cannot think of anything that&#8217;s less hospitable than setting the menu and demanding your guests pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Would you ever ask your guests to pay for a family dinner? Have you ever paid for a family member&#8217;s Christmas dinner?</p>
