			<p>People don&#8217;t want to share their things with others. Some people don&#8217;t care if someone takes their stuff, but most people don&#8217;t want their stuff taken without their permission. If you paid for the things yourself or got them for free, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re a child or an adult.</p>
<p>A father thought it was normal to want to keep things for himself, so he bought his daughter a lock as her cousins were constantly taking her things without her permission. The father wants to know if he should have done anything after the family split.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A dad is upset after a family fight that he caused when he put a lock on his daughter&#8217;s room so her cousins couldn&#8217;t take her stuff.</h2>

<p>His wife and daughter live in Quebec, Canada. A couple of months ago, his BIL Sammy divorced his wife and was kicked out of their home with his twin daughters. Sammy&#8217;s sister welcomed him to her family home despite the fact that his parents weren&#8217;t willing to take him in.</p>
<p>A huge problem surfaced when the father said that his daughter isn&#8217;t close with her cousins, but they do get along. The older cousins completely disrespect the privacy of the OP&#8217;s daughter Zoey by using all her stuff without asking first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>There was a divorce and the OP and his family didn&#8217;t have a place to go.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187104" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-61d70ce735bc9__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="599" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-61d70ce735bc9__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-61d70ce735bc9__700-300x257.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /> <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187103" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-61d70cef072fe__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="309" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-61d70cef072fe__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-61d70cef072fe__700-300x132.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>They take her things. The dad thought that this was not right. The mom and Sammy believed that girls always share things with each other, so there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>When the cousins made Zoey cry, it broke the dad&#8217;s heart. The OP said that his daughter had saved up money and bought an eyeshadow kit. One of the cousins ruined it. Some people on the internet said that it might have been intended to tease Zoey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The problem is that the OP&#8217;s nieces and cousins ruin his daughter&#8217;s things without asking.</h2>

<p>After this, the teenager kept her more valuable belongings at her friend&#8217;s house, and when the dad found out, he got Zoey a lock for her room. Sammy was offended when he found out why the lock was put up. He said that his daughters are just taking each other&#8217;s stuff because it&#8217;s how it works with girls. He thought it was wrong for Zoey to want to look older and shamed her parents for allowing her to wear makeup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The man thought it was a good idea to put a lock on his daughter&#8217;s door.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>His wife wasn&#8217;t on their side and they argued that girls always share things.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187109" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7-61d70cf5a9371__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="417" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7-61d70cf5a9371__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7-61d70cf5a9371__700-300x179.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The teenager&#8217;s mom was on her brother&#8217;s side. She thought that putting a lock on the door made it harder for the cousins to spend time together and now that the girls are living with them, they should be treated as daughters.</p>
<p>The dad was going to take the lock off when the BIL&#8217;s family moved out. His wife thought he was suggesting that Sammy and her daughters should be kicked out, which would make her family angry. They welcomed Sammy into their home because the wife&#8217;s parents wouldn&#8217;t let their son and granddaughters stay at their home for a while.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187110" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8-61d70cf763924__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="471" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8-61d70cf763924__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/8-61d70cf763924__700-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The lock will not be removed if the BIL and his daughters are living under the same roof.</h2>

<p>A lot of tension was created in the house because nobody is talking to the dad and Zoey. The OP wrote in the comments that his daughter felt like she was doing something wrong, even though she was the one who suffered from her cousins.</p>
<p>The comments reassured the dad that he did what needed to be done and that his daughter would be very appreciative even if she didn&#8217;t say anything.</p>

<h2>He asked if he overreacted by putting a lock on the door because the family wasn&#8217;t talking.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187113" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/11-61d70cfd1db49__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="309" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/11-61d70cfd1db49__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/11-61d70cfd1db49__700-300x132.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Do you think Zoey and her dad overreacted and offended a family that recently went through a rough time? If you were her parent, would you give her a lock too? Let us know what you think in the comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>People in the comments didn&#8217;t think that the cousins were thieves and thanked the father for being a good father.</h2>
