			<p>We know that the headline might have amazed you. But yes, that&#8217;s true that a bird of prey was caught carrying a large fish, probably a shark, away in its talons. Luckily, this video has appeared on the internet and is raging on social media.</p>
<p>Onlookers on Myrtle <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/two-days-before-nyc-beaches-reopen-shark-shows-up-at-rockaway-beach/">Beach</a>, South Carolina were lucky enough to see this view live. The site of a giant bird swooping over the sands and carrying away a large fish left all of them stunned. And Tennessee native Ashley White shot the video of the bird from the 17th floor of the apartment where she stayed for a vacation. The viral video shows the fish still wriggling around trying to escape on June 22.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyone know what type of bird this is and is it holding a shark? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/myrtlebeach?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#myrtlebeach</a> ðŸ“½ Kelly Burbage <a href="https://t.co/gc59xihiM7">pic.twitter.com/gc59xihiM7</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The video then appeared on <a href="https://twitter.com/trackingsharks">Twitter</a> profile, Tracking Sharks. And there, the video has gathered a lot of views. It sparked a debate amongst the netizens to know what type of bird it was.</p>
<p>Many of them even argued whether the big fish was a shark or not. Some suggested that the large bird was an osprey. While others joked that it was a pterodactyl. The other social media users thought it might be a condor or an eagle.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-93924" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shark1.jpg" alt="Onlookers see an osprey carrying a shark " width="634" height="326" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shark1.jpg 634w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shark1-300x154.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shark1-561x288.jpg 561w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shark1-364x187.jpg 364w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/shark1-608x313.jpg 608w" sizes="(max-width: 634px) 100vw, 634px" /></p>
<p>However, many of them agreed that the bird was an osprey and probably the fish he carried was a shark. Others said the fish was a mackerel rather than a shark because of the shape of its tail. A chiefÂ meteorologist with local media outlet WPDE shared White&#8217;s footage to his Facebook page. He argued the bird was an osprey that had caught a &#8216;large Spanish mackerel&#8217;.</p>
<p>And South Carolina Department of Natural Resources calls the ospreys as fish hawks or fish eagles locally.</p>
