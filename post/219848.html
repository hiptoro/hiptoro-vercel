			<p>Kody yet lost another one of his Sister Wives.</p>
<p>In a sneak peek for the upcoming Sister Wives: One on One special, which aired at the end of Sunday&#8217;s episode, the Brown family patriarch was asked about his relationship with Janelle Brown.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am separated from Janelle,&#8221; said Kody, 53. &#8220;And I&#8217;m divorced from Christine [Brown].</p></blockquote>
<p>Janelle, who is also 53, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kody and I have separated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Janelle married Kody in a polygamous marriage in 1993. She is the second matriarch of the Brown family to go solo, after Christine. Christine and Kody had been married for 25 years when she told him she was leaving him in November 2021.</p>

<p>Kody is still married to both Meri Brown and Robyn Brown, but his relationship with Meri has turned into a friendship.</p>
<p>All season long, Kody has had trouble with both Janelle and Christine. Kody and Janelle thought about whether or not their relationship was still working in last week&#8217;s episode. Kody even felt like he had to &#8220;beg&#8221; Janelle to get closer to him.</p>

<p>Janelle felt like she had to &#8220;do everything she could to make this work,&#8221; but she wasn&#8217;t sure if it was even possible to turn things around from where they were.</p>
<blockquote><p>I never thought that I would ever be in a place where I would be questioning my relationship, but the last few years, I began to wonder if we&#8217;re compatible anymore,</p></blockquote>
<p>she said in an interview later.</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe this doesn&#8217;t work anymore for me. I don&#8217;t know.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this week&#8217;s episode, Kody and Janelle got into a big fight because she didn&#8217;t follow his COVID-19 safety rules. But Janelle thinks she did all she could, given how bad things were, and she doesn&#8217;t think she should have to &#8220;defend&#8221; herself.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the same ol&#8217; argument. I don&#8217;t need to be beaten into submission, made to kowtow. I&#8217;m just not. I just don&#8217;t need this,</p></blockquote>
<p>she said.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the last 18 months, I&#8217;ve realized that I&#8217;m pretty good. I&#8217;m independent, and I&#8217;m not going to stand here and be yelled at. I just don&#8217;t need it. I don&#8217;t deserve it and I don&#8217;t need it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Janelle also worried about the future of the Brown family in the same episode.</p>
<blockquote><p>I just think we&#8217;ve never had divides this deep,</p></blockquote>
<p>she said.</p>
<blockquote><p>Christine has left, and that&#8217;s obviously [a] very, very big departure for what our family has looked like for many years. This is like the ultimate test of our family. Can we hold it together with all of this?</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sister Wives is aired on TLC every Sunday at 10 p.m. ET.</p>
