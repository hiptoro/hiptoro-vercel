			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">German Shepherd is a medium-sized dog breed originated from Germany. They have a life expectancy of approximately 13 years and they make super friendly family dogs. This doggo breed is not just known for being sweet and cute but also for being intelligent and smart. That’s why they are often seen working in police departments. This loyal and courageous dog breed is ready to do anything for the ones they love the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To show how amazing and incredibly awesome these little pooches can be, we have combined a few pictures just for you. Some of the dogs are napping happily, some are being funny, some are being cute, and some are joining K-9 units. Scroll down and enjoy these cutest pictures.</span></p>
<h2>#1 We Always Thought He Would Grow Into His Ears</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102669 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-23.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tracking the history of German Shepherds, we found that this amazing doggo breed caught the attention while returning from home with soldiers from World War l. After this, German Shepherds also played an important role in World War ll. And since then, this breed has become the first choice in the military. </span></p>
<h2>#2 Branch Manager &amp; Assistant Branch Manager</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102670 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-23.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of all the dog breeds, German Shepherds are considered to be highly active and athletic. However, if they are not provided proper training, they grow frustrated and angry. That’s why it is always said to train a puppy in a safe area from starting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a German Shepherd, you can make him participate i</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n canine activities such as agility, herding, tracking, and dock diving. </span></p>
<h2>#3 First Day At Work</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102671 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-24.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have also talked to dog behaviorist Nick Jones MA to know more about German Shepherd. He said, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Provided that the owner is not a complete novice, has experience of training and living with larger protective breeds, the German Shepherd makes an excellent choice of dog for a family.” He further added, &#8220;Take time and care to find a reputable breeder that can show you dogs with a good parentage and can demonstrate a sound temperament in the parents and previous litters, as living with a nervous or under-socialized German Shepherd can be stressful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Jones, this amazing dog breed needs plenty of mental and physical stimulation. For new owners, he said that they should give a great deal of time and effort to their puppy in the initial stages of training. He also added, &#8220;Provided that training, socialization and good manners are put in place from a young age, this a breed that remains highly desirable.&#8221;</span></p>
