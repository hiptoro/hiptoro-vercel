			Bride Complains Her Wedding Dress Looks ‘Nothing Like Order’, Gets An Email Saying It’s Inside Out
		  </h1>
			<img src='https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Bride-Complains-Her-Wedding-Dress-Looks-‘Nothing-Like-Order-Gets-An-Email-Saying-Its-Inside-Out.jpg' />
			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A perfect wedding dress is what every woman wants for her big day. That’s why she starts looking for “the perfect dress” everywhere. But there is no limit to the bride-to-be’s anger when she receives her wedding dress that looks nothing like what she has ordered online. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This similar incident has happened with the bride-to-be Deux Aubrey who has ordered a stunning wedding dress online. After that, she also wrote a letter to the store. But the store’s response made her embarrassed. The store told her that she was wearing the dress inside out. We know it’s funny but we should now laugh or maybe, we can. (Wink-Wink)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deux has even posted about the entire thing on the Internet and netizens can’t control their laugh. “This was not a joke, I wish it were but I am not that creative,” she wrote. For those asking ‘How this happened?’, Aubrey explained “I was sleep-deprived from doing 16-24 hour shifts for a living and having to go through her finals week”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I have no idea about fashion or shipping measures for formal dresses. I wear scrubs and tactical boots for a living,” Aubrey continued. “No, I am not a natural blonde but it fits the bill on this one. Hoping other brides can read this and not panic or get upset when their dress arrives in the mail.”</span></p>
<h2>A few weeks ago, bride-to-be Deux Aubrey ordered a wedding dress on the Internet and couldn’t wait to receive it</h2>

<h2>When the dress finally arrived at her doorstep, Aubrey was sleep-deprived, in a rush between jobs, and generally upset with having to prepare for her big day online</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-115252 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-74.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1045" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-74.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-74-201x300.jpg 201w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-74-686x1024.jpg 686w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>This is how the dress was being marketed</h2>

<h2>But when her partner laced her up, Aubrey looked like this</h2>

<h2>She got really angry and contacted the company, trying to return the dress</h2>

<h2>But after going through her photos, the company told Aubrey she had worn the dress inside out</h2>

<h2>The woman made a humorous Facebook post explaining the situation</h2>

<p>“To answer confusion, yes, I said ‘husband’ [and] no, I’m not taking a second [one],” Aubrey said in an update of the post. “We signed the paper for us. But are planning a wedding for photos, families, and friends at a better point for us financially. You are never too late to have the wedding of your dreams. And never allow the stress of self-paid wedding finances dictate your readiness to commit to each other.”</p>
<p>“That decision for us was before Covid but now definitely many brides are finding themselves in the same boat. A marriage and a wedding never have to happen on the same day, all in the timeline that works for you. People who love you will understand your financial [situation] or current safety constraints and show up later down the road anyway,” Aubrey said.</p>
<p>“I’ll take a real pic [in the dress] when we finally get to walk down the aisle in a pandemic-free setting and may recirculate this moment for another stressed out bride, once again. The save the dates we send out to our loved ones are for sure gonna say something like ‘to see the dress worn right’.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad you could join us with a light heart and laugh <em>with</em> us into that forever. May your wedding ‘disasters’ be simple fixes or at least one day hysterical in retrospect too.”</p>
<h2>And it went viral</h2>
