			<p>The one to fear Tom Hardy, a famous actor who has worked in the entertainment industry in both the United States and the United Kingdom, once stated that actor Shia LaBeouf knocked him out during one of their fights. Now, many people are probably wondering how the second fighter managed to knock out the first fighter, especially considering that the first fighter is an avid practitioner of Brazilian jiu-jitsu.</p>

<h2>Tom Hardy Gives His Side of the Story Regarding His Fight With Shia LaBeouf.</h2>

<p>Tom Hardy has a reputation for getting into fights on the set of his movies, though the fights in question are quite different. He has mentioned in the past that he got into a fight with actor Shia LaBeouf while working on the set of Lawless.</p>
<p>After the premiere of the crime drama that John Hillcoat directed in 2012, rumors started to spread when the director told users of the social news website Reddit about their conflict, stating, “It escalated to the point where they had to both be restrained.”</p>
<p>During an interview in 2011, Hardy gave an interview to Den of Geek in which he confirmed the same thing by saying, “I got knocked out by Shia LaBeouf, actually in Wettest County, apparently.”</p>
<p>After he admitted to getting into a fight with LaBeouf, he made the following statement: “[It was] behind the scenes, he knocked me out sparko. Out cold. He’s a bad, bad boy. He is. He’s quite intimidating as well. He’s a scary dude.”</p>
<p>When questioned about what led to the confrontation, he provided an evasive response by stating, “He just attacked me,” provoking laughter. “He was drinking moonshine. I was wearing a cardigan, and er, went down. I woke up in Pnut’s arms.”</p>
<p>For those who are unaware, Pnut served as Hardy&#8217;s personal trainer back in the day. Despite this, his side of the story didn&#8217;t seem to hold much water, which is especially surprising given that he is a jiu-jitsu practitioner. It is important to note that he did not explain why the altercation occurred; however, LaBeouf did share his narrative in which he described what actually took place.</p>

<p>In 2018, the actor provided a more accurate narration of Tom Hardy&#8217;s story. During his conversation with Esquire, he made the following statement:</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s a bunch of bullshit. We used to wrestle all the time and he’s a big fucking person, especially then. He was getting ready [to play] Bane.”</p>
<p>He shared the following in his explanation of the circumstances that ultimately resulted in the altercation between the stars:</p>
<p>“My girlfriend at the time was over at my house, we were on this balcony. We saw him and his trainer coming back from the gym. We used to f**k with each other all the time but it just so happened that, this one week, my girlfriend was in town and he runs into the room. The girl I was with at the time was terrified. She covered up and she ran into the kitchen.”</p>
<p>After that, he went on to explain how the actor had been &#8220;knocked out.&#8221;</p>
<p>“He picked me up and I didn’t have anything on so now I’m naked on his shoulder. We’re in the hallway, we’re wrestling around … We wound up inching over to the stairs and he fell down the stairs. He wound up hurting his back.”</p>
<p>The actor provided an explanation that he was hurt while &#8220;wrestling around,&#8221; and for the remainder of the time, he claimed that LaBeouf &#8220;knocked him out,&#8221; despite the fact that this was not the case.</p>
