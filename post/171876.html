			<p>Have you ever been suspicious of a friend or coworker? Maybe you have a sinking feeling when you think of a person or place. Do you think a company is trying to pull the wool over your eyes?</p>

<h2>1. A family secret.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Earguy/">u/Earguy</a></p>
<p>I think a relative is a CIA agent. She was in the Peace Corps. She&#8217;s been a &#8220;world traveler&#8221; ever since, able to drop her work and go to exotic destinations. She had injuries when she came back. We were climbing some rocks when I fell. Her son is married to a CIA translator and is an employee of the agency.</p>

<h2>2. Shutter Shock.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cwltv7/what_do_you_strongly_suspect_but_have_no_proof_of/eydoq60/">justthatoboist</a></p>
<p>I think that a Canadian guy who owns an antique shop that I bought a camera from in April recognized me. I came back the next day to make my purchase after he acted flustered when I came in. He gave me the camera for what I thought was a reasonable price and also threw in an owner&#8217;s manual that was in perfect condition.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a very rare camera that was only produced for two years. One out of every 1000 working ones still has a certain part, and 1 out of every 1000 still in existence are operational. My dad talked to the shop owner about how to modify his camera, and he even showed me how to find a film for it.</p>
<p>He lost a lot of money on the transaction.</p>

<h2>3. The Bigfoot Theory.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cwltv7/what_do_you_strongly_suspect_but_have_no_proof_of/eyd3lly/">u/Unleashtheducks</a></p>
<p>Bigfoot is a cultural memory from humans who migrated from Asia. The creature went extinct tens of thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. Bingo.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cwltv7/what_do_you_strongly_suspect_but_have_no_proof_of/eye7gyf/">u/mlg2433</a></p>
<p>About 10% of lottery winners actually win. Someone has to win sometimes. People would get suspicious if there were no winners. Who would know if there was a real winner?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. A scary grandma.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cwltv7/what_do_you_strongly_suspect_but_have_no_proof_of/eyepg25/">u/Reloaded9mm</a></p>
<p>I think my grandmother was a murderer. She was married seven times. She passed away in the 1980s, but everything is still suspicious. I found an article about her when she came to the US, where her first husband defended her after her ex-boyfriend climbed in her window.</p>
<p>She was in prison before she came to the US.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. Pavlov is a human.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cwltv7/what_do_you_strongly_suspect_but_have_no_proof_of/eycvdpd/">u/Adomoto</a></p>
<p>Saying &#8220;OK Google&#8221; is Pavlov teaching humans to comply with AI and machines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. The theory of everything.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Alundra828/">u/Alundra828</a></p>
<p>I think that the purpose of life in the universe is simply to create a new universe.</p>
<p>To me, this is the only way for any living to ensure its amusable survival always. And I am not talking about just human life. I think that our chances of survival are super slim.</p>
<p>Consider this. Every problem life will ever encounter will have a solution. The only limiting factor to life-solving a problem is the time since a species has enough resources to exploit any resources it wants.</p>
<p>Time is not infinite in the universe. There will be a time when the atoms in the universe begin to decay. Life&#8217;s final deadline is this. Life in the universe will be extinguished forever if life in its different forms can&#8217;t escape. How does one escape a universe that is collapsing?</p>
<p>The universe makes it so that this is the ultimate problem to solve. Life is the powerhouse of the universe if the mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell.</p>

<h2>8. Bad teacher.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MaterialImportance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MaterialImportance</a></p>
<p>I think my English teacher only gave us grades on the basis of how we were in class and not the essays we wrote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9. &#8220;Smile!&#8221;</h2>
<p>From a Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cwltv7/what_do_you_strongly_suspect_but_have_no_proof_of/eycm6pf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ghrew</a></p>
<p>Dentists ask you questions because they think it&#8217;s funny to watch you struggle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>10. Smarter than you think.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/spazmcgee1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spazmcgee1</a></p>
<p>The Kardashians wear clothes that are solid-colored because it makes it easy for them to Photoshop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>11. Hide and seek.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/sakura_wayne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sakura_wayne</a></p>
<p>You never see the empty exhibits at some zoos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>12. There&#8217;s a reason for no wait.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/anonymousjohnson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anonymousjohnson</a></p>
<p>A lot of businesses in my hometown are money-laundering operations. There are 25 nail salons in the town. Commercial rents are very high in the best block of downtown where a DVD rental shop is located. Dozens of $10 barbershops are still open. There were red flags around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>13. Sort of &#8220;Now Hiring&#8221;.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fancyfrenchtoilet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fancyfrenchtoilet</a></p>
<p>Monster.com can sell your data to advertisers, and most of the job listings on the site are fakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>14. Head for the hills!</h2>
<p>From a Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cwltv7/what_do_you_strongly_suspect_but_have_no_proof_of/eyenhg9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElCiscador</a></p>
<p>I feel that something bad will be happening to my city. A lot of mansions are on sale. Rich people know something that the rest of the people don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>15. Hot and ready!</h2>
<p>From a Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cwltv7/what_do_you_strongly_suspect_but_have_no_proof_of/eycvslq/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JimmyL2014</a></p>
<p>I think your phone and laptop mics are sending data to certain groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>16. The royal promise.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CrabFarts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CrabFarts</a></p>
<p>Prince Charles won&#8217;t be on the throne. I believe he gave up his right to sit on the throne in exchange for being allowed to marry Camilla. When Queen Elizabeth passes, Prince William will be on the throne.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>17. The success smell.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Arcticshade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arcticshade</a>:</p>
<p>I think that Bath &amp; Body Works has 13 unique scents. They call them something else when they change the scent every couple of months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>18. The Twitterpocalypse.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cwltv7/what_do_you_strongly_suspect_but_have_no_proof_of/eydtqqx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ambermage</a></p>
<p>There is a group of people who think they are protected from the world. Anyone looking for reasons to oust someone from a position of power or authority will be able to find this information.</p>
<p>You want promotion in 20 years. Outcomes that were sent to HR were drunk from a social media post. The promotion was denied. Your rival gets it. The post qualifies as public information, so it&#8217;s not subject to defamation charges. This could become a large-scale business with the help of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>19. The business plan.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Joeysaurrr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joeysaurrr</a></p>
<p>I believe that Apple did not intend for anyone to buy a $999 monitor stand. It was just an excuse to invalidate warranty claims for the Pro monitor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The use of improper third-party equipment is the reason we can&#8217;t approve your claim.&#8221;</p>
<h2>20. An undercover sibling.</h2>
<p>From a Redditor u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/alienblooded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alienblooded</a></p>
<p>I think my oldest brother is my biological father.</p>
<p>It makes no sense to me. No one in my family has a left chin. The older brother has substance issues and is a big mess. It makes no sense to me that he came out of that with zero children because he brought different women to my parents&#8217; house every day. My mother would have had me at dangerously old age if he had been younger than me. It&#8217;s not impossible, but it makes a lot more sense. My parents covered up for him, so it wouldn&#8217;t surprise me.</p>
<p>I once asked my mom, and she was very upset. I told her that I had a dream that my brother was actually my father. She refused to acknowledge or discuss my dream. It was weird as hell.</p>
