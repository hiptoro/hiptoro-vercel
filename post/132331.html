			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sometimes, we just do things because it seems right. Like if someone is having a hard time crossing the road, we help them. If a person falls down, we help them to get up. And when we see a pregnant lady on public transportation, we get up to give her our seat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it seems like not everyone has common sense and good manners. Recently, we have come across a story where a person refuses to give his seat to a pregnant lady because he was exhausted. </span></p>

<h2>Being tired is no excuse to let your morals go</h2>
<p>“I was tired and had a long day, and I don’t know why we need to keep perpetuating the idea that breeding somehow means your entitled to people’s seats. I’m tired, too, we’re all tired in this pandemic,” the Redditor wrote in their story.</p>
