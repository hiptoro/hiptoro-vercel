			<p>Remy Merrit disappeared from her home at 8:30 PM on June 14th. The search party was ecstatic when they found her— then they realized she wasn&#8217;t alone&#8230;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is not surprising how loyal dogs are towards their owner. Here we have the story of Remy Merrit a 3-year-old girl who went missing from her rural home. But she was not alone since her dog was protecting her the entire time. If this dog was not with her this family would have lost their little girl.</span></p>
<p>Remy was last seen playing on the swings. Her mother went inside the house to get something. And after she returned she realized that Remy is missing she was nowhere to be found.</p>
<h2>Once the mother realized her baby girl was neither in the house nor outside, she panicked and called the police.</h2>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>“I looked for her by myself thinking maybe she was just in the woods or somewhere where I just couldn’t see her,” Timber, Remy’s mother told PEOPLE.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>“And I was just calling for her and calling for here, and when she wasn’t calling back I realized ‘I don’t think I’m going to find her on my own.’”</p>
<p>Realising that her daughter was missing she immediately called the police with her cracky voice.</p>
<p>The palce is very friendy where they live, so in a matter of minutes after getting the news, a group of volunteers joined the search. It was difficult to navigate because the place and the houses were all surrounded by fields of corn. The community was worried for the baby girl&#8217;s safety.</p></blockquote>
<div id="bored-2081029140" class="bored-adsense-wrap"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-187428 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-1.jpeg" alt="" width="467" height="350" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-1.jpeg 467w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-1-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></div>
<div></div>
<div>Helicopters searched for the girl and circled all around the place. But the wheat was way too high and obstructed the visibility.</div>
<div>
<h2>The day had come to an end so the police and the volunteers had to end the search, in hopes that the new day will bring new hope.</h2>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>“It was stressful and emotional,” a family friend told ABC News.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>“We were all just walking back and forth from one end to the other just yelling her name.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>“All the flashlights started dying and the sheriff’s office decided to call it for the night.”The search continued in the early morning hours.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<h2>The search continued in the early morning hours.</h2>
<p>The biggest problem was again the corn. “You don’t hear well in the corn,” a volunteer explained. “When somebody is yelling your name, you can hear them, but you don’t know where it’s coming.”</p>

<h2>Finally, good news put everyone’s worry at ease. Remy was finally located. She was safe, but not alone!</h2>

<h2>Man’s best friend has confirmed once again why he gets to be called like that! The family’s pet terrier, Fat Heath, never left the girl’s side and kept her safe during the night</h2>
<p>If Fat Heath wasn’t with Remy God knows what would have happened to her. It was really getting very difficult to find them. Luckily, the police and the neighbors heard him barking and managed to locate the missing girl.</p>
<p>“The dogs yapping at each other is a neat little moment,” Parrot said.</p>

<h2>Neither Ramy, nor Fat Heath were injured!</h2>
<p>After they were admitted to hospital, the doctors said Remy was only exhausted and really thirsty.</p>
