			<p>Kindness does lack these days. People are not kind towards humans, so the lest that you can expect from them is to be kind towards animals. The lockdown has still motivated people to help each other, and thus many cases were shared by people on the Internet. Today, we would like you all to know about a woman who has shown extraordinary effort towards animals and has made us believe that kindness does exist. This lady lives with 162 animals. Yeah, that a lot of animals but we would like to appreciate here for doing this act of kindness. Scroll down to meet Adri and her animals.</p>

<p>Do you have the feeling of envy because Adri is pursuing her dream of helping animals and now lives with plenty of pets? Yes! However, the amount of efforts she makes to keep them happy and healthy is simply jaw-dropping.  Nobody can actually do all that Adri does even if they have unlimited funds. It takes a compassionate person to make all these efforts.</p>
<p>She founded the Wild Things Sanctuary after many years of working towards rescuing animals that desperately needed assistance. “It became clear to me that this wasn’t a hobby for me, it had been the story of my life since I was a child and I wanted to officially choose it as my life’s primary focus,” she told Hiptoro.</p>

<p>Adri shared with us, that it seemed like Fate wanted her to look after these neglected animals. “Animals that are broken and in danger have always seemed to cross my path and knowing that I’m offering them a safe place to heal gives my life a purpose and that reward far outweighs all of the time, money, and sadness running an animal sanctuary can bring,” she revealed.</p>
<p>When asked about how does she manages all of this, she replied “While the reality of caring for this many animals means I’m doing it morning until night, 7 days a week, without vacations, I love every minute of it.”</p>

<p>“I receive their affection, smile at their joy, laugh at their antics, and reciprocate their love all day long! If I wanted to <em>only</em> meet their basic needs, food, water, cage cleaning, I could be done within a few hours and walk through those steps in my sleep at this point, but that is never what I want,” she opened up to us that she goes the extra mile.</p>
<p>“So, after adding in the spending time with all of them, even if it is just observing them, it’s a full day. It’s my heaven on Earth… but it is technically very demanding. This is especially true because the residents are generally either neglected, seniors, unhealthy, or unhandled.”</p>

<p>Adri told us that having so many animals acts as a benefit for so many other animals that are in need.</p>
<p>“A dog may be terrified of me at first, but it learns from the others here that this home is safe, and takes comfort and joy from the other dogs. A feral pig doesn’t have to face its fear of humans, it gets its social needs completely fulfilled by the other pigs. The parrots can spend an entire day conversing and interacting with other parrots, which is really more fulfilling of their natural needs.”</p>

<p>She candidly also answered us when we asked her about what is the financial pressure on her to look after these animals.</p>
<p>“The operating costs right now, starting out and being tasked with building permanent structures and fencing, etc., are huge. Being a newer sanctuary also means we aren’t established enough for people to be donating large amounts. I think it’s important that anyone who pursues this path is financially prepared to be investing all of their own money in the beginning,” she said.</p>

<p>“The feed bills average $1,300 a month. Vet care fluctuates greatly but on a yearly basis, we can generally predict about $10,000. Setting up the sanctuary over the last year has cost around $50,000 in materials.”</p>
<p>She is so dedicated to her cause that she even sold her dream truck to help save a herd of cattle that were bound for slaughter. “I think for animal lovers it goes without saying that every dollar is so worth it, but it is a huge financial sacrifice. Caring for nearly 200 animals, and wanting to be prepared to offer a home to emergency cases in need at any time is expensive!”</p>

<p>“I also pride myself on always exceeding an animal’s basic requirements for living… I want them to be spoiled and try to create homes for them that are absolutely over the top and incredible! Thrive instead of just survive!”</p>

<p>Adri explained that her sanctuary is different from others. “One of the biggest goals I have, that sets us apart from a lot of other facilities of this type, is <em>not</em> being open to the public… which means there’s a huge potential source of income we’re missing out on.”</p>
