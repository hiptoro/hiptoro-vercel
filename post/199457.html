			<p>Knowledge is power but some people are guilty of learning things that almost feel illegal to know. There are things that you think you shouldn’t know because it’s not your place, but actually, it’s not classified information, it just sounds like it.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, my dad taught me how to pick a lock. I became very interested in different kinds of locks and purchased a lock pick set. I practiced for years and became pretty good at certain types of locks. So over the years every now and then, if a neighbor locks themselves out of the house or a friend loses the key to a padlock or a lock box I’ve been able to help. But the reactions I tend to get from people, even while I’m helping them with their lock is mainly one of mistrust. I’m not a cat burglar. I just like locks.</p>

He is fed a huge piece of meat every morning and sits on a rock that is changed to the perfect temperature for him everyday so he has no reason to attack anyone on the safari ride.</p>

Unionization saves you more money than it costs you, you cannot be punished for attempting to do so, and it is NOT in any way illegal, rude, or improper to discuss your salary with your coworkers.</p>
<p>It feels illegal because every company on the f*****g planet has tried to make people think unions are evil monsters trying to get you to pay union dues for no return. This is false because union dues are much less expensive than a company underpaying you and trying to work you to death, which a union fights against. Unions are there to prevent worker exploitation, stop it if people were being exploited when they got there, and get you a fair wage that will actually let you live off of one job instead of needing 4-5 or to work criminal amounts of overtime.</p>

Creating Nitrogen triiodide. When in liquid form it is stable but once it dries so much as a fly landing on it creates a purple smoke explosion. It&#8217;s so unstable that alpha radiation can be used to detonate the stuff.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually easy to get the materials and create the stuff. Filled my high school hallway stairs with purple smoke on the last day of school.</p>

One thing I learned is in the state of California if you are squatting a property for five years and have been upkeeping it with proof, you can file a claim of ownership with the courts and take over any property as long as it was deemed that the original owner never tried to remove you within the same timeframe.</p>

Read a personal finance book that recommended calling your providers once a year (credit card companies, TV/internet providers, cell phone company, etc) and demand a lower rate or price. I’ve been following that advice for two years and have not been denied once.</p>
<p>Last week I saw a commercial for my internet provider offering a super low introductory rate so I called to demand that I get that rate. They said no problem and now I save an extra $700 a year because of a 5 minute call. I am a very passive introvert so it’s not the most easy or comfortable thing but the money I save is worth it. They may so no initially but if you ask a few times or ask to speak to their supervisor they very usually give in.</p>
<p>*Edit the book is called “I Will Teach You to be Rich” (cringey title, awesome book imo)</p>

When you have a debt with a collection agency you can pay the debt and then call back a few weeks later and say, “I was told when I called and paid that you’d remove this from my credit score.” And then you ask for documentation saying they’re gonna do it. Apparently collection agencies don’t keep super good records on stuff like that; they just want your money. It worked for me, and I hope it can work for you if you need it in the future.</p>

I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s still a thing, but if you listen to Pandora radio the songs download into your temp folder under your browser. Just add the. Mp4 after it and you can play it.</p>
<p>I spent lots of college listening to Pandora, and if I liked a song I&#8217;d save it. If you paused the song in time then the most recent song was the top one in the temp folder.</p>

In Canada you can record any conversation with someone without their knowledge, unless it is in furtherance of an offence.</p>
<p>I had to do this with an auto restoration shop in order to do a Visa chargeback when they did nothing to my car but steal parts for almost a year (Curtis Customs in Nova Scotia &#8211; I don’t mind mentioning them because there are already news stories about their scams)</p>
<p>EDIT: A lot of replies from people possibly misreading. If &#8220;you&#8221; are recording a &#8220;conversation with someone,&#8221; you are part of the conversation and would be the consenting individual (one party consent). It&#8217;s definitely wrong and illegal to record just any conversation between two or more other people</p>

I had a stats prof who used to work for the US government. I&#8217;m not sure exactly what his job was, but it definitely involved evaluating the status and readiness of nukes, both ours and the USSR&#8217;s (he was probably at least 70 and had been retired from that job for a while). One day in class he just started talking about the percentage of nukes that fail (ours and theirs) and why they fail and all kinds of other, seemingly sensitive, information. I don&#8217;t think he would have told us anything classified, but his personality was boisterous and irreverent enough that I am not sure. I literally expected a team of spooks to bust down the door at any minute and drag us all off for interviews in windowless rooms.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re on a jury you can vote for someone as innocent even if you think they did it. Most common reasoning for this would be if you just think that they shouldn&#8217;t be punished for whatever they did. I can&#8217;t remember the term for it something like Third Option.</p>

In regards to military grade bombs and missiles, it takes actual effort to make one go off on the ground. Like, you literally have to go out of your way to arm the fuse, then sit around for a timer to detonate said bomb.</p>
<p>Its not like in the movies, where a soft breeze or some nutjob with a hammer, will make a bomb just explode for no reason.</p>

1284x is a Ford fleet key. Not chipped, can be found on Amazon for $7 and is perfectly legal to replicate.</p>
<p>Searching &#8220;1284x&#8221; filetype:.pdf site:.gov</p>
<p>Will pull government bids that involve that key, and also show you what agencies you could open up or drive away a police car.</p>
