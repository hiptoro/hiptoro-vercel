			35+ Actors Who Gave Unscripted Authentic Performances

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hollywood screenwriters always do a great job and come up with unique dialogues. These dialogues are remembered for years. But sometimes, actors give unscripted and authentic performances that they knew nothing about before shooting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, some of these unscripted scenes have become really iconic. Just like in Friends, Rachel mistook the dummy falling from the stairs to be Ross and gave a genuine horror reaction, these characters knew nothing about their respective scene. </span></p>

In the movie Now You See Me, Isla Fisher&#8217;s character performs a magic trick that requires her to be in a tank underwater that she needs to escape from. In the scene, she struggles and starts to drown, unable to get out. While filming the scene, Isla was actually in the tank, and she wasn&#8217;t pretending to drown — she was actually drowning. Her release chain got stuck on her costume, and she wasn&#8217;t able to get out quickly. Everyone thought she was just acting really well, however, she was actually panicking, struggling to get out of the tank for nearly three minutes before she was rescued.</p>

<h2>Cary Elwes Wasn’t Acting When He Got Hit In The Head In Princess Bride</h2>

In one scene in Princess Bride, Cary Elwes’ character Westley gets clonked on the head pretty hard by the six-fingered man, played by Christopher Guest.</p>
<p>But when it came time to film the scene, the stunt didn’t look realistic enough. So Elwes suggested that Guest knock him as hard as he could using a real metal sword.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the angle, we couldn&#8217;t sell a fake blow well enough for the camera, so I told him to just hit me hard,&#8221; Elwes wrote in his book, As You Wish.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that’s the last thing I remember. I woke up in the hospital.&#8221;</p>

Camp may be the place for bonding, but this boot camp was really tough, and the fact that Matt was at home relaxing definitely created a divide. It was so horrible that after day four, everyone wanted to quit, but Tom Hanks encouraged them to stick it out. Matt said that when he eventually showed up on set there some resentment from the guys, and it translated onto the screen.</p>

In one scene, Marty gets strung up on the famous Hill Valley clock tower. In what was without a doubt something he later regretted, Fox said “Sure” to performing the stunt himself.</p>
<p>The plan was for him to use his hand to keep the noose from tightening around his neck and actually strangling him. In practice, he couldn’t get his hand into position and actually blacked out for a minute, until the crew realized what was happening and saved his life.</p>

In the scene, you can see Jennifer Jason Leigh break character and scream and look at the crew because she was in disbelief when the antique guitar – which was supposed to be swapped out with a prop in between takes – got smashed.</p>
<p>The old guitar, which was made in 1870, was actually on loan from a museum. Dick Boak, the museum&#8217;s director, changed their policy because of this mishap and said, &#8220;As a result of the incident, the company will no longer loan guitars to movies under any circumstances.&#8221;</p>

The meticulousness with which the film was created had a cost: Shelley Duvall’s wellbeing. Kubrick tormented the actress, making her do relentless takes, while verbally abusing her and dismissing her acting talent. This was intentional, as revealed in The Making of The Shining. Stanley Kubrick’s daughter, Vivian Kubrick, described how her father terrorized Duvall in order to make the insecurity of her character viscerally apparent.</p>
