<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Making someone feel left out is never a good idea. Probably that’s why </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Alex and her family gave their dog his own graduation photos. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, Alex and her family wanted a dog for a long time. So, when they adopted Ollie, they were happiest and decided not to make him feel left out. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ollie’s always been treated like another one of my parents’ children. We always joke that he’s their favorite,” Alex, Ollie’s sister, told The Dodo. “Coincidentally we got Ollie at a similar time that my sister moved away to university. So, he really is my parents’ new child. He’s everyone’s favorite family member. Our friends even laugh at us for how obsessed we all are with Ollie. We even go on dog-friendly holidays every year just so we don’t have to leave him behind.” </span></p>

<p>“We always said he was a professional good boy, so we thought we’d make it official with his own dog-ploma,” Alex said. “He’s a typical retriever who loves to carry things, so he was very pleased with himself when we gave him his own scroll to hold for the photo. After a quick photo with the camera, he got lots of praise as usual. We took the hat off of him, but he didn’t want to give his scroll back.”</p>

<p>“I forgot about the photo until my mum and dad had my own graduation photos printed,” Alex said. “They decided that they didn’t want to leave Ollie out and had his photos printed as well without telling me. It gave my sister and me a big laugh when we saw Ollie’s graduation photo on the wall next to ours.”</p>

<p>“We snuck it into my Nan’s house alongside all of her other grandchildren’s graduation photos,” Alex said. “She thought it was hilarious and she loves it. It’s now her favorite photo and she shows anyone who comes to see her.”</p>

<p>“They’ve seen it all — Ollie’s on our Christmas cards, our clothing, our phone cases … literally everything,” Alex said. “All of our friends and family know to expect this kind of thing from us by now.”</p>
