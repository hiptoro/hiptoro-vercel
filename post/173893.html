			<p>Unless you are very lucky or live in the wild, there is a chance that you will face your neighbors at some point. And unfortunately, chances are high that it was something that never made a difference in your life until they started to bother you about it.</p>
<p>For example, I had a concept that seemed to mean very different things to others (including the city) than their property lines. This meant it wasn&#8217;t uncommon to hunt down delivery men and technicians standing between our houses.</p>
<p>But while each neighbor&#8217;s story is different and it is certainly not interesting to deal with, some situations are simply unacceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>For about a year, tech writer Bobbie Hineman has lived with a new neighbor by her side.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-173895" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/7iG4iVWqPycoy1tZI3B6.png" alt="" width="1024" height="765" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/7iG4iVWqPycoy1tZI3B6.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/7iG4iVWqPycoy1tZI3B6-300x224.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/7iG4iVWqPycoy1tZI3B6-768x574.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>From what we can tell, this arrangement was largely uneventful for a while and Hineman&#8217;s little girl (not pictured) spent a lot of time running around in her backyard playing and laughing merrily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>However, it seems that this child was laughing too hard or too much for the neighbors&#8217; liking.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-173896" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/8dmHhGMwJ2gmXk5xNZfx.png" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/8dmHhGMwJ2gmXk5xNZfx.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/8dmHhGMwJ2gmXk5xNZfx-300x225.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/8dmHhGMwJ2gmXk5xNZfx-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>This person sent Hineman a letter saying that he was disturbing his two dogs and birds who like to look at his backyard through the window.</p>
<p>It was unclear what kind of reaction the child&#8217;s laughter apparently caused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>But what was clear was that the neighbor was willing to call the police if the child continued to enjoy in a way that didn&#8217;t suit his taste.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-173897" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/V5WZXp26Z4k8yARCL958.png" alt="" width="1024" height="1174" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/V5WZXp26Z4k8yARCL958.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/V5WZXp26Z4k8yARCL958-262x300.png 262w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/V5WZXp26Z4k8yARCL958-893x1024.png 893w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/V5WZXp26Z4k8yARCL958-768x881.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>What&#8217;s also puzzling is that the neighbor seemed to assume that Hineman would view her son&#8217;s happiness as a &#8220;problem&#8221; that she was &#8220;too inconsiderate&#8221; to correct rather than as something nice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>When Hineman posted this on Twitter, users were shocked by the response from her neighbor.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-173898" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/qzzhsDVHdLgV783jSYHA.png" alt="" width="768" height="627" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/qzzhsDVHdLgV783jSYHA.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/qzzhsDVHdLgV783jSYHA-300x245.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>One of them suggested buying a horn for her child, to which she replied that she thought a drama might be a better way to show her neighbor how good they really are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>And that classic idea of ​​exacerbating neighbors clearly upset some people&#8217;s imagination.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-173899" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VxUwLVibNUBPQK4sXRiv.png" alt="" width="2160" height="1533" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VxUwLVibNUBPQK4sXRiv.png 2160w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VxUwLVibNUBPQK4sXRiv-300x213.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VxUwLVibNUBPQK4sXRiv-1024x727.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VxUwLVibNUBPQK4sXRiv-768x545.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VxUwLVibNUBPQK4sXRiv-1536x1090.png 1536w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/VxUwLVibNUBPQK4sXRiv-2048x1454.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" /></p>
<p>Someone else suggested making it even bigger and getting a complex set like the one announced by Rush drummer Neil Peart. It certainly seems to be packed with more than enough to help a healthy kid make all the noise he wants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Not surprisingly, another couldn&#8217;t believe it was a real letter.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-173900" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-129.png" alt="" width="597" height="326" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-129.png 597w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-129-300x164.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" /></p>
<p>But another user shared his story about a similar situation. This shows that no one seems to hate more than the sounds children enjoy. Some people seem to talk more about it than others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Another user immediately envisioned this neighbor in his mind and shared what we call an artist rendering.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-173901" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-130.png" alt="" width="598" height="703" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-130.png 598w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-130-255x300.png 255w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /></p>
<p>I can only imagine what the dispatcher&#8217;s reaction would be like. Although I guess you don&#8217;t know what kind of strange calls they get every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Others can only imagine the reaction of the police if the neighbor carries out his threat.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-173903" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-131.png" alt="" width="594" height="290" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-131.png 594w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-131-300x146.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" /></p>
<p>If anything, depending on whether they are brutal enough to call 911 about it, they may be uncomfortable to see themselves as police caution. Doing so when it&#8217;s not urgent is, after all, a quick way to find a price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>But someone else summarized their feelings with this handy pillow.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-173905" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Neighbor-Sends-Mom-Letter-Threatening-To-Call-Police-Because-Of-Childs-Laughter.gif" alt="" width="525" height="487" /></p>
<p>And while you know where they come from, it&#8217;s good to remember that not everything is bad. After all, if everyone thinks their neighbors are rational, then you really have to wonder what&#8217;s going on in this world, but that&#8217;s obviously not the case.</p>
