			<p>They say &#8220;take your broken heart and make it into art.&#8221; In Stephen Beals&#8217; case, it is more turning negative emotions into humorous comics. Yes, you&#8217;ve heard it right, &#8220;Adult Children&#8221; is back here.</p>
<p>Stephen Beals is an artist who has been drawing comics since forever &#8220;out of pure love for the art form.&#8221; As Stephen said himself, his illustrations are something he made after work to let off steam. He titled them &#8220;Adult Children&#8221; because, according to the artist, &#8220;adulthood seems to be a myth we tell children in order to get them to behave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Below are his humorous Comics that retail workers and regular people will probably relate to.</p>
<h2>#1 <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-193007 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-92.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="946" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-92.jpg 880w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-92-279x300.jpg 279w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/1-92-768x826.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></h2>
<p>The characters in these comics are Stephen Beals divided into four different parts. A truly interesting concept. The artist believes that we all have different personalities, or at least Stephen has &#8220;four usable ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the artist explained, Penny and Berle are brother and sister. Harvey (named after Stephen&#8217;s grandfather) has known them since they were kids and has formed a long-term relationship with Penny.</p>
<p>Harvey is Stephen&#8217;s ego, Berle is his complete ID, Penny is his small part of the responsibility, and Claremont (the dog) is Stephen at his best, &#8220;which is why he&#8217;s a dog.&#8221; There&#8217;s also Todd (an extra), who represents the naive side of the artist.</p>

<p>The artist told us that he graduated with a degree in animation from the California Institute of the Arts. For nearly all of his college years, according to Stephen, he was still a teenager and, thus, still stupid. &#8220;I made a bad choice. I love animation and film, but I ultimately didn&#8217;t want to work in the industry. I wanted to make comics, which notoriously doesn&#8217;t pay enough to buy the luxuries I&#8217;ve grown accustomed to, like toilet paper, so I wound up working for the university library. I love libraries! Who doesn&#8217;t? If you don&#8217;t, find out more at your local library.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stephen continued: &#8220;The library I worked for was busy. Very busy. &#8216;I&#8217;m going to die&#8217; busy. I dealt with every kind of person imaginable. Libraries are similar to retail except they&#8217;re free to the public, so everyone is welcome unless they are actively trying to set the place on fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought about becoming a librarian, but I spent quite a bit of money on my art degree and it was kind of like letting a good bottle of milk spoil. I left to work in advertising. For quite a few years I designed every ad conceivable and worked on marketing strategies to sell things that I wouldn&#8217;t buy unless it was to resolve some sort of hostage negotiation. Advertising wound up being somewhat cold and monotonous. I missed people, even the weird ones like myself.</p>
<p>At times, I would work part-time at large retail stores to help pay for my expensive habit of heating my house. I liked working with people again, but it was hard to get passionate about daily retail concerns like price tag placement or expired candy bars.</p>
<p>I combined my two passions and made a conscious decision to go back to serving the public at a print shop. I wound up working for quite a few printing establishments and now work for one of the biggest. I get to design things and deal with very strange people at times. Perfect!&#8221;</p>

<h2>#7 <img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-193013 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/7-85.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="950" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/7-85.jpg 880w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/7-85-278x300.jpg 278w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/7-85-768x829.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" /></h2>
<p>Being busy working at the print shop, the artist still manages to post comics every day. For Stephen, it&#8217;s the best part of his day. &#8220;To paraphrase the great writer Shelby Foote, &#8216;It takes me a very long time to get started on something and I solve that problem by never stopping once I&#8217;ve started.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The most challenging part of the creative process for the artist is the idea he is trying to convey. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard other cartoonists describe writing comics as being similar to writing poetry, and I used to scoff at that, but I now think it&#8217;s true. The pacing with dialog has to be on key or it doesn&#8217;t work. I know this because I&#8217;ve made hundreds of comics that don&#8217;t work. Honestly, that&#8217;s the way I learn everything. A few hundred failures equal success.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an old adage that good writing can overcome bad art, but good art can never overcome bad writing. I depend heavily on this adage when I&#8217;m in a hurry. Some comics I make only for me, like the one I did using an iambic parameter. Those are too much fun to count as failures even if I&#8217;m the only one enjoying it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stephen shared that he loves to write and we guess you noticed that already. &#8220;If there&#8217;s anything that I love as much as comics, it&#8217;s books. I am constantly listening to an audiobook, reading a book, and reading blogs. If offered a writing gig I would not hesitate to throw myself into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The artist is also a huge fan of old humorists. &#8220;Many humorous essay books were illustrated by very good cartoonists and I always think of those as perfect books. I hope to have an eBook out if only to please myself and have something for people to actually buy. Short of that, a blog post or weekly essay is something I wish to resume (I did do that some time ago for websites that no longer exist).&#8221;</p>

<p>What originally made the artist passionate about comics was newspaper cartoonists from his childhood. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a unique form of entertainment. Today, my passion remains alive by those who are currently making comics. I would put today&#8217;s crowd of cartoonists up against any in the history of the medium. I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of meeting a number of my fellow creators and they never cease to make me laugh and love everything about cartooning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I receive more personal responses to my comics about retail than anything I&#8217;ve ever made in the past. People have written me to share some very hilarious stories as well as others that describe painful work scenarios. Really, that&#8217;s more rewarding than any amount of money. As far as I know. I&#8217;d like to test that theory by getting a large amount of money and comparing the two, but this experiment lacks funding.&#8221;</p>
