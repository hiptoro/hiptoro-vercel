<p>&#8220;Her being a lesbian obviously isn&#8217;t a weird reason to get divorced, but it&#8217;s a great story and kudos to my aunt for coming out and leaving her husband at a time (in the &#8217;70s) when both were arguably less popular than they are now.&#8221;</p>

The groom was dancing with his sister at the reception, and the bride asked to cut in. His sister tried to punch her in the face but missed and punched the bride’s sister. All hell broke loose. The night ended with the bride asking the groom to choose between her or his sisters. He chose his sisters.&#8221;</span></h2>
