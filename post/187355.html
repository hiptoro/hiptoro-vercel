			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For everyone their first salary is memorable. That’s because they finally have money of their own, and they feel like they can buy anything they want. Some people use their first paycheck to upgrade their lifestyle, while others use it to buy things for their loved ones. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here is the story of a 21-year-old son who uses his first paycheck to pay off his parents’ entire mortgage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back in 2017, Pavin Smith </span><span style="font-weight: 400">was the seventh overall draft pick in this year&#8217;s baseball draft. He signed to the Arizona Diamondbacks and was given a hefty $5 million bonus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of buying any luxury for himself, he decided to pay off his parents’ entire mortgage to the house so that they wouldn’t ever have to worry about it. He also uploaded a heartwarming video of that moment in which he is explaining that their Christmas present was the mortgage payment. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pavin </span><a href="http://www.insideedition.com/arizona-diamondbacks-prospect-surprises-his-parents-paying-their-mortgage-christmas-39288"><span style="font-weight: 400">wrote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">: &#8220;Thank you for raising me in a great home filled with love. Because of all the sacrifices you made to get me where I am, I want our family home to be yours.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the magnitude of this present, Pavin says it doesn&#8217;t even begi</span><span style="font-weight: 400">n to make up for all that his parents have given him. I have to say I agree — if I could pay off my parents&#8217; mortgage, I&#8217;m sure I would.</span></p>
<p>This is going to be one hard <a href="https://www.littlethings.com/poppy-the-christmas-baby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christmas gift</a> to follow! I have to wonder what Pavin will do for his family next year.</p>
<p>If u like the story don&#8217;t forget to share it with your friends and family.</p>
