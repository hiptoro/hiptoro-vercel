			<p>Did you know that about 3.2 million cats go to shelters in the United States of America? Out of this massive number, only 1.6 million get adopted. Those people who are fortunate to adopt an animal and give them a forever home receive lots of love.</p>
<p>A subreddit BeforeNAfterAdoption celebrates people who adopt animals and shared their achievements. Today, we bring you across 30 cats who got adopted and went to their forever home where they are happy and healthy.</p>
<h2 id="post0" class="open-list-header">#1 Its Been A Year</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-119151 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-116.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="488" /></p>
<p>As recorded by the experts, over 35% of homes in the U.S have a cat. So what are the rest of your still waiting for? Anyway, it is a big responsibility to adopt an animal. We do understand that and resect your decision of not adopting one. But do you realise that humans also have a happy and healthy life when you bring home a pet. They are always around you to lift your mood and make you happier.</p>
<p>If you wish to know about cat adoption, you can get the checklist from American Humane to learn about cat care guide.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s end things off with a quote from Matthew Bershadker, ASPCA President and CEO, that really puts things into perspective: &#8220;Helping vulnerable animals and keeping pets in safe and loving homes requires a commitment from all of us—advocates, pet owners, shelters, leaders, and entire communities. When we work together under a common cause, we&#8217;re both saving lives and elevating our society and its laws to ensure cruelty victims and other at-risk animals receive the protection and care they deserve.&#8221;</p>
