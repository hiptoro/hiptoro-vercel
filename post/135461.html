<h2>1) I’ll Take That Off Your Hands</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">Seriously, seagulls are the worst thieves. Or I guess the best ones. Anything you hold sacred should be left in the car or at home because they don’t care who you are, they will hoard your stuff.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135462 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-113.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="1108" /></p>

<h2>2) You Wouldn’t Like Her When She’s Angry</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This girl is nice enough. But when she’s angry, she turns into the crazy frog lady. Here we see her moments after transitioning. It’s a scary sight, but she’s one that you will want as an ally.</div>

<h2>3) This Is So Fitting</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">With all the rage against cops, let’s look at the humble firefighter. No one has ever had a problem with these guys and here’s why. So many of them are volunteers and were made to wear wings.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135464 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3-108.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="432" /></p>

<h2>4) Taste The Rainbow</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">Is Obama trying to steal the magical powers of the leprechaun or is he sending out love to the world? The world may never know but we do know that something insane is going on here.</div>

<h2>5) He Has A Quest</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This cat most definitely has a quest for you and it will not be an easy one. You actually have to be level 100 to unlock it, so he’s giving you this look until you get there. Until then, be gone, peasant.</div>

<h2>6) Buddha Just Got Cooler</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">Trying to keep up with kids these days, this Buddhist god put on some shades and is looking at you funny. He even seems to have that lip curl and is thinking about getting gauges in his ears.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135467 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/6-108.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="484" /></p>

<h2>7) To Another World</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">Is it just me or did this guy find a portal to another world? Either that or he is getting cryofroze in a jelly of some sort. He’ll see your grandkids sometime next century. Thank you for your sacrifice.</div>

<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>8) Just A Little Tense</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This one took me a second. But if you look at his shoulders, you can see the creepy sun giving him a shoulder rub to ease the tension brought on by a public speech. If anything, he’s making it worse.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135469 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/8-108.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="422" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>9) Don’t Text Anyone, Except Us</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This “safety” sign is telling us not to text, which is great. But then it says to text them for more tips. They should have specified for us to wait until we’re stopped to do so. Because humans need really specific instructions.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135470 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/9-102.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="520" /></p>

<h2>10) Two-Timing Bride</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">Somehow, this bride managed to kiss two guys at the same time without the other one knowing it. That’s some crazy stuff. Do you think her groom will think twice about their kids having gills?</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135471 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/10-104.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="975" /></p>
<h2>11) Mitsubishi: Because You’re Worth It</h2>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">These eyes are so intimidating. How can you concentrate on driving when you have these intense beauties staring at you? This is definitely hypnosis and I wonder what is under that tarp.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135472 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/11-104.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="866" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>12) And She Became A Frog</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This is just like Princess and The Frog. Tiana kisses the frog and turns into a frog instead of vice versa. A much better story than the original. Only this girl will probably be in good spirits about it all.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135473 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/12-101.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="546" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>13) Reading Your Own Bio Like</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This is the face you’d make if you were reading your own bio that someone else wrote. “This isn’t how it happened at all, but at least I’m the coolest character in the story and you can’t like me.”</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135474 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/13-106.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="565" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>14) Oh hi, I Didn’t See You There</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This shot is so perfectly at times that so many things had to happen to make it happen. The birds, the people, the boat, the shadows, and the scenery. Now, this is a fate clothes in a feathered unibrow.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135475 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/14-102.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="845" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>15) Here, Fishee Fishee</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">Do you ever see clouds shaped like something unique? That’s just your imagination. This is the real thing. This cloud looks more like a fish than a fish does. And he is looking for a snack as we speak.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135476 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/15-102.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="433" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>16) The Legendary Birdeer</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This bird likes to show off, especially when he gets to show off his antlers. He has a really nice pair so we can’t blame him and those ears look fantastic on him. What would you do if you saw him in person?</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135477 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/16-96.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="785" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>17) Never Get That</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This dude should never get that mustache. If he did, he’d probably be harassed big time. Such an uncanny resemblance to a certain dictator. This man may mean well but he should be more careful with his mic placement.</div>
<figure class="article-ad-horizontal center-xs"></figure>

<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>18) She’ll Be Here All Week</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This looks like a Disney World reject. She’s happy and ready to terrify other kids around the park. This illusion wouldn’t work so well if it weren’t for her matching clothing. The kid was born to be Minnie.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135479 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/18-89.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="709" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>19) We Come In Peace</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">I’m not sure if those are his arms or antennae. But more than likely, since this is for sure an alien, it’s a new body part that humans can’t comprehend. At least he looks like a peaceful sort.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135480 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/19-85.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="480" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>20) Finally, A Worthy Subject</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">Anyone else gets tired of the picture of people holding the Leaning Tower of Pisa up? It’s kind of cheesy even though I’d totally to it if I were there. However, no one can pull it off like this good boy.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135481 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/20-79.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="944" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>21) I Can’t Stop Looking</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">I don’t even want to know what’s going on here. Sure, I’ve never seen a horse give birth up close but I’m pretty sure this isn’t how it happens. Maybe he too is an alien who is trying to blend in.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135482 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/21-68.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="1040" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>22) I, Cosplay</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">Not sure what this wave is trying to be but he looks like that peak in the background. Maybe he’s a chameleon trying to copy his surroundings. Or maybe this is what he looks like every day.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135483 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22-63.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="813" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>23) Caught On Earth</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">Look at this angel. Not only did someone take a picture at the perfect time but their subject is perfect for the job. She has the flowy sweater and white Charlie’s Angel&#8217;s heels. Yes, she got the part.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135484 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/23-62.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="487" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>24) The Better Angel</h2>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">Okay maybe to better but this might be the cutest little birdie that you’ve ever seen. She’s got the wings and she knows how to use them. Her parents are raising her right and that’s easy to see.</div>
</div>
<figure class="article-ad-horizontal center-xs"></figure>

<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>25) Just Chilling, Not Skiing</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This is a perfectly times water skiing fail. The dude looks so relaxed but he actually just fell and is skipping along the surface on his bottom. That’s the power of a good water skiing trip.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135486 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25-59.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="431" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>26) Total Eclipse Of The Ball</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This dude made his shot, with the basketball of course, and it went better than he expected. A photo was snapped and it gave us a “solar eclipse” using the ball to block the sun. Now that’s cool.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135487 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/26-57.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="409" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>27) Gene Loves Ice Cream</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">Do you know that kid who is always trying to be intimidating and freaking conservative teachers out with shirts like this? Well, this just kidified it by letting Gene Simmons take an ice cream break.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135488 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/27-54.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="919" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>28) The Legendary Boss</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This is an amazing shot! Even if it were just the eagle, it would be fantastic. But with the dude in the background, it’s as if he’s transforming, or seeing his own spirit animal right in front of him.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135489 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/28-56.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="546" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>29) It Was Bad Enough Before</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">These two have really unfortunate last names but it just got ten times worse when they stood next to each other. They probably got made fun of as kids and now those bullies have something better to laugh at.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135490 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/29-55.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="425" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>30) No, Edward, No</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">I hope that this vampire is there to donate the extra blood packs that he found in his fridge. He doesn’t like O- so he gives them away regularly. On the other hand, he could be there to steal a few too.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135491 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/30-52.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="820" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>31) Or Just Milk</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This isn’t good no matter how you look at it. Either the baby is drinking alcohol or the baby stuff is on the same aisle as the liquor. Because parents need to drink? You never know about people.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135492 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/31-31.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="318" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>32) Nice Tan, Indeed</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This is what happens when you spend all summer with your shirt off and wear pants. Your legs get pasty and you get a nice upper body tan. They are nice legs though, much more feminine than one would think.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135493 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/32-28.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="545" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>33) Don’t Step On Him</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">Let’s pretend his name is Oscar so we can say that Oscar deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of “white rug” in the living room. If you haven’t seen him yet, then it’s a good thing, it means he’s better than we thought.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135494 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/33-25.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="603" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>34) Off By One</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This is more than a coincidence. This is the lottery telling this dude that no matter what, they will never be a winner so they might as well give up now. That’s rough, and it might be a good time to find another way to spend your money.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135495 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/34-25.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="440" /></p>
<div class="slideshow-part">
<h2>35) Don’t Wear Red</h2>
</div>
<div class="slideshow-part slideshow-desc">This shirt-face is a good way to keep people away from the red shirts. Do you see how there are most of them despite red being a popular color? It’s because that monster is scaring people away.</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-135496 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/35-22.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="1040" /></p>
