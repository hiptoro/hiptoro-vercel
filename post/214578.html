			<p>At her funeral, a woman in Texas gave her family and friends a funny card that said, &#8220;Stay in touch&#8221; and had a picture of an Ouija board.</p>
<p>A death notice for Jo Marie Perryman was published in the Andrews County News on Wednesday, October 12.</p>
<p>Despite this, Jo Marie did not let her terminal illness make her lose her sense of humor.</p>
<p>The grandmother planned for her funeral to be on October 18, and she had cards made to remind people that she was not that far away.</p>
<p>On the card that was given out, there was a picture of the grandmother. In the photo, her tongue and what looks like her two middle fingers are sticking out.</p>
<p>Along with the photo, there is a note that says, &#8220;let&#8217;s keep in touch.&#8221; It is placed right above where a small Ouija board decal has been stuck.</p>

<p>The picture of the card that has since gone viral on Twitter was first posted by Jo&#8217;s granddaughter, Gracie Perryman. She did this so that everyone could hear how funny her grandmother&#8217;s idea was.</p>
<p>&#8216;Received this at my grandmas funeral. What an icon,&#8217; the granddaughter¬†<a class="class" href="https://twitter.com/qrracie/status/1582471507363536897?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1582471507363536897%7Ctwgr%5E83c66653bfbee1fd85b55c208dd79618ae3aac19%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnypost.com%2F2022%2F10%2F20%2Fgrandmother-gets-the-final-laugh-at-her-own-funeral%2F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">said</a>.</p>
<p>The tweet itself was very popular on the social media app, and it got a total of 659,000 likes in the first three days after it was posted.</p>
<p>The card has been retweeted by more than 65,000 people, and another 5,000 people have quoted and tweeted it.</p>
<p>Jo Marie quickly became known as &#8220;a legend&#8221; on the social media app because of her funny ideas. Thousands of strangers told her how funny she was.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;I am so sorry for your loss. However, this is the stuff of LEGENDS! And now, you have it to look at whenever you feel down,&#8217; one person¬†<a class="class" href="https://twitter.com/cynmdmi/status/1582858219856179203" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">responded</a>.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;This is amazing‚Ä¶ I am going to do this when I die in honor of your badass grandma!

<p>It also made a lot of people want to talk about how their own loved ones had helped them through hard times with humor and hope.</p>
<p>&#8216;The last time I got to talk to my best friend, before ovarian cancer took her, I asked her to send me a postcard from her next adventure. I get little signs every once and awhile. It&#8217;s a nice thing so this just make the messaging easier. Brilliant,&#8217; one Twitter user¬†<a class="class" href="https://twitter.com/pawf1067/status/1582881312444018688" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>.</p>

<p>Another woman posted a picture of the funeral card for her own father online. She had hidden it behind a pair of costume glasses with a mustache on them.</p>
<p>&#8216;Received these at my dads, she wrote.</p>

<p>In a post on Tuesday, Litina Griffin, who is Jo&#8217; Marie&#8217;s niece, said that she made the cards. She wrote in the post that she couldn&#8217;t disappoint her aunt on such an important day.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;When Aunt Jodie Perryman asks for this in her final days, I couldn&#8217;t disappoint,&#8217; Griffin wrote in a post.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;Everyone at the funeral got one of these in an envelope marked &#8216;from Jodie,&#8221; the woman said.</p>
<p>In her Facebook status update, she also showed a screenshot of Jo&#8217;s post, better known as Jodie. In the post, Jo said that everyone who came to her funeral should get an Ouija board with the message written on it.</p>
<p>&#8216;I miss her already,&#8217; Griffin wrote. &#8216;And apparently now she is famous.&#8217;</p>
<p>Before the story came out, a source tried to get in touch with the relative but did not hear back from them.</p>
