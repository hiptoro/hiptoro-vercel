			<p>We all come across some people in our life who work for our well-being selflessly. And this always surprises us as we always wonder where do these people come from. But whatever the case may be, they always turn up when we need them. And one of them is an Alabama man, Rodney Smith.</p>
<p>He was just 15 years old when he met an elderly man who was struggling to mow his lawn. After helping the gentleman, he was inspired to help as many as people he could. So, he began to mow the lawns of the elderly, veterans, disabled people, and single moms. Then he decided to take it to the next level and came up with an organization. And you&#8217;ll be surprised to know that they are not only helping the people in the US but also inspiring other children to do the same.</p>

<h3>Alabama man, Rodney Smith help people mow their lawns</h3>
<p>As the founder of <a href="https://weareraisingmen.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Raising Men Lawn Care Service</a>, this Alabama man, Rodney has inspired over 700 kids to participate in the beautification challenge and mow 50 lawns in their community. To keep them motivated, he also provides regular perks. He sends them a different colored t-shirt for every 10 lawns they mow to eventually reach a black t-shirt in lawn mowing. The organization&#8217;s motto is “Making a difference one lawn at a time.”</p>
