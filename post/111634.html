			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you know what’s sad? It’s the fact that even though people have started adopting pets, they turn away from senior and disabled pets. We understand that disabled and senior dogs need more love, attention, care, and have special needs. But hey, c’mon, they deserve it all! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, these elder and disabled pooches have spent most of their lives in a shelter house. So now, it’s time that they should get the love that they deserve. And you can help them get the kind of life and love they have been craving for this long. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To give you a little inspiration, we at Hiptoro have brought a sweet and heartwarming story of a couple named </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Chris and Mariesa Hughes based in Clifton Park, NY. Interestingly, this loving couple is a proud parent of not one but 20 disabled &amp; senior dogs. OMG! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scroll down to see the pictures. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The duo has started a non-profitable organization after their senior pup, Mo, passed away. This is to help senior and disabled dogs</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. After the dog died, they found the heavy vet bill left behind by him. And this thing has inspired them to start The Mr. Mo Project. Through this organization, both of them want to help senior dogs that get abandoned year each all over the country. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Senior dogs deserve the best for the rest of their lives. We believe that senior dogs deserve homes too!” The Mr. Mo Project writes on its website.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You will be amazed to know that both of them have already helped nearly 100 dogs </span><span style="font-weight: 400">from euthanasia. Besides other dogs, the couple gives special care to the 20 pups that are living with them. T</span><span style="font-weight: 400">o give the best and most comfortable experience to the pups, this couple has spent around $55,000 on customization. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The couple has brought a kind size bed of </span><span style="font-weight: 400">$5,000 for their pup. In addition to that, they have also brought a hydrotherapy pool for $30,000. Besides this, they have customized the entire house in a way that it is dog-safe and friendly with ramps. So you see, the couple has put a lot of effort, brains, patience, and money into doing all of these things. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chris told us that, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">“it is crazy living with 20 dogs, but we make it work as we have a great routine.”</span></p>

<p>He further added &#8220;we try and raise as much money as we can. But ultimately, if one dog needs $20,000 worth of treatment, we will pay for it on credit cards and worry about it later. There’s always a vet bill to pay. But we have learned to get on with it and although it’s stressful, it’s all worth it.&#8221;</p>
