			<p>Prior to the development of infant formula and feeding bottles, wet breastfeeding was a widely used practice. A woman does have the option to use the natural products that her body makes in a powerful and beneficial way. And this is similar to what Salma Hayek, the Frida actress and longtime advocate for women&#8217;s rights, did when she gave her milk to a baby belonging to a complete stranger who was starving and malnourished.</p>
<p>Hiptoro loves to recognize celebrities who are committed to helping others. And here&#8217;s a touching tale of a Hollywood actress that demonstrates how sometimes minor changes may have a tremendous impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A genuinely kind and unselfish deed.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208839" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/d85ddf5faea2a1c55ab4a753b4.png" alt="" width="728" height="749" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/d85ddf5faea2a1c55ab4a753b4.png 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/d85ddf5faea2a1c55ab4a753b4-292x300.png 292w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>In September 2008, actress and producer Salma Hayek traveled to Sierra Leone as a volunteer for an African humanitarian effort, not as a famous person. She came to meet a mother who was out of milk while touring a hospital. Hayek, who at the time had a 1-year-old daughter, took the stranger&#8217;s underweight 1-week-old kid and started breastfeeding him in front of numerous TV teams.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Encouraging her daughter to grow up to be a kind and compassionate person.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208838" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ec92495659ace454eeca1875b0.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="396" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ec92495659ace454eeca1875b0.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ec92495659ace454eeca1875b0-300x163.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>After the breastfeeding episode, she acknowledged that she had conflicting emotions about maybe betraying her own daughter by providing her milk to someone else. But she afterward reasoned that her daughter wouldn&#8217;t mind sharing her milk, so she said instead “I actually think my baby would be very proud to be able to share her milk.” She added that she would encourage her to remain a kind and giving person as she grows older. And she proudly added, “I think that’s the best thing I can give her as a mother.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hayek comes from a long line of generous and giving people.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208837" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/8837665a78827c112a8fb73deb.png" alt="" width="728" height="854" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/8837665a78827c112a8fb73deb.png 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/8837665a78827c112a8fb73deb-256x300.png 256w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Hayek said that it was a long-standing custom in her family to assist a youngster in need in this way. In reality, many years ago in a Mexican town, her great-grandmother fed the infant who was sobbing uncontrollably and quickly stopped crying, saving the starving baby of the stranger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Breastfeeding is not a stigma, it&#8217;s a decision.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-208836" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/a281dd5650a787f1b00c07c10e.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="594" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/a281dd5650a787f1b00c07c10e.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/a281dd5650a787f1b00c07c10e-300x245.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Hayek asserted that she also intended to lessen the stigma attached to breastfeeding by choosing to breastfeed that stranger&#8217;s child. She also made a strong statement about how women should have a choice and not be frightened of their bodies with this deed of kindness.</p>
