			Twins Born Just 15 Minutes Apart Have Different Birthdays in Different Years
		  </h1>
			
			<p>When you see a pair of twins, you make an assumption that they are born on the same day. This is mostly true in almost every case because when twins are born, there is barely a time gap of a few minutes. So, apparently, all twins in the world share the same birthday.</p>
<p>However, in a rare situation, it occurs that twins are born on different days. You must be wondering how is that possible. Well, we aren&#8217;t saying that the two babies are born days apart from each other. Instead, it happens like one baby is born before midnight and the other is born post-midnight</p>
<p>It is very rare that twin kids have two different birthdays. However, what is even rarer is that twins have different birthday months and different birth years. Confused?</p>
<p><a href="https://people.com/parents/twins-born-in-different-years-15-minutes-apart-2021-2022/">Fatima Madrigal and Robert Trujillo</a> are parents of twin babies who are just a couple of days old. Fatima delivered the babies at Natividad Medical Center in Salinas, California. Their daughter, Aylin Yolanda Trujillo is the first baby born at the medical centre and the first baby in Monterey County in 2022.  Her birthday is 1/1/22.</p>
<div class="ad_ph"></div>
<div>What&#8217;s unusual in their story is that Aylin, the one born at midnight has a different birthday than her twin brother who was born just 15 minutes before her. Alfredo Trujillo, Aylin twin was born on New Year&#8217;s marking his birthday as 31st December&#8217;2021.</div>
<p>Natividad Medical Center shared the adorable picture of the twins on their Twitter handles announcing the first birthday of the year.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">At midnight, Natividad welcomed Aylin Yolanda Trujillo as the area&#39;s first baby of 2022! Her twin, Alfredo Antonio Trujillo, was born 15 minutes earlier at 11:45 pm Friday, Dec. 31, meaning their birthday falls on a different day, month and year— a 1 in 2 million chance! <a href="https://t.co/Lm5hkOpNBo">pic.twitter.com/Lm5hkOpNBo</a></p>

<p>In a press release from the medical center, Fatima Madrigal, the twins’ mom shared her feelings about the unusual experience. She explained, “It’s crazy to me that they are twins and have different birthdays,” she added. “I was surprised and happy that she arrived at midnight.”</p>
<p>The mom’s doctor also shared what she felt about the situation. Dr. Ana Abril Arias explained, “This was definitely one of the most memorable deliveries of my career.” She went on to say, “It was an absolute pleasure to help these little ones arrive here safely in 2021 and 2022.” She summed up her feelings by stating, “What an amazing way to start the New Year!”</p>
<p>There are approximately 120,000 sets of twins born in the United States every year. That makes up just 3% of all births.</p>
