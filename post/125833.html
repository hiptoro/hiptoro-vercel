			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, our furry babies do something weird that really shocks us. Like the cute dog of Vince Matteson of Poland, Oregon surprised him by going on the top of the roof. When this guy saw his dog on the top of his house, he started thinking about what got him there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then he decided to see the footage of the CCTV camera installed in his backyard. From there, he got to know that his super-skilled puppy has climbed the ladder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scroll down to see the images.</span></p>
<h2>Vince found his dog Ace on the roof of his house while he was taking down his lights</h2>

<p>The owner told us, “ace—the dog that was climbing, I’ve had since he was a puppy and he just turned 2 years old last week on the 14th. Super adventurous and not fearful at all. The dog on the ground is Bo, who I adopted from ‘Golden Bond Rescue’ in March! Bo is the cuddly one. I was up on the roof taking down my Christmas lights. I was on the other end of the house, I turn around and see Ace on the roof! Then I thought maybe a roommate was playing tricks on me and put Ace up there, but I checked my security camera and to my surprise, he climbed up the ladder!”</p>
<h2>Vince was very confused about how Ace managed to get up there</h2>

<p>“I was absolutely shocked! I had my headphones in so I did not hear him, but I saw him out of the corner of my eye. First thought was to pull out my phone to document it, second thought was how the heck am I getting him down. I ended up calling a roommate to hand him down.”</p>
<h2>Vince viewed the security camera footage later on and saw how exactly Ace managed to climb up</h2>

<h2>Let’s just say Ace has some amazing climbing skills and is the adventurous type</h2>

<h2>He managed to climb up all the way using a ladder to come to help out his owner</h2>

<h2>Vince’s other dog Bo decided he would stay on the ground, he’s the more cautious type</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-125842 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8-8.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="391" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8-8.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8-8-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8-8-438x246.jpg 438w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>“My roommate was home, called him up and the only thing I said was ‘Umm…. Grant… Will you come out to the backyard for a second?’ He climbed up the ladder and I handed him, Ace. Ace is about 75lbs, so it was definitely a difficult task.”</p>
<h2>Here’s what the ladder looks like from above</h2>
