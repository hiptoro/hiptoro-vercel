			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Someone has truly said that children are god’s gift to humans. After all, kids teach us so many things that we usually forget in our day-to-day life. Be it loving each other or showing incredible kindness, kids know it all. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we are talking about kindness, we would like to show you pictures of some kids who have demonstrated pure kindness in their own way. Scroll down to have a look. </span></p>
<h2>Real Heroes</h2>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-132009 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-5.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1050" /></h2>
<h2>My Six-Year-Old Nephew Bridger Saved His Little Sister’s Life By Standing Between Her And A Charging Dog</h2>

<p>After getting bit several times on the face and head, he grabbed his sister’s hand and ran with her to keep her safe. He later said, “If someone had to die, I thought it should be me.” After receiving 90 stitches (give or take) from a skilled plastic surgeon, he’s finally resting at home. We love our brave boy and want all the other superheroes to know about this latest hero who joined their ranks.</p>

<p>It is an honor to raise such a loving, compassionate child! He’s a kid with a big heart, the first day of school started off right.</p>
<h2>Just Wanted To Shed Some Light In This Dark World We Live In</h2>

<p>My beautiful nana passed away on August 9th, peacefully in her home. Please never forget this beautiful story. It was meant to spread love and kindness, and unfortunately many have turned it into something so negative.</p>
<h2>12-Year-Old Kid Makes Shelter Cats And Dogs Stylish Bow Ties To Help Them Find A Home</h2>

<p>Despite his young age, a 12-year-old from New Jersey with a heart of gold, Darius Brown has taken an initiative to help our furry friends get adopted much faster. He creates handmade stylish bow ties for four-legged companions (cats and dogs) and donates them to animal shelters to attract the attention of future owners.</p>

<h2>Late Last Night, Myles Went On And On About How He Had To Be Twins With A Boy In His Class For Twin Day Because They Look Exactly The Same — Same Eyes, Same Hair. He Was Adamant That They Were Identical</h2>

<p>So, after the kids went to bed, I headed to Walmart at 9 p.m. to get matching outfits. Their teacher sent me this picture today. My heart melted.<br />
Obviously, they are two very different children, but Myles didn’t see that. Wouldn’t the world be such a better place if we could all view it through the eyes of a couple of 5-year-olds?</p>
<h2>A 7-Year-Old Promise</h2>

<p>A lot of grade-school-aged kids may have stayed away from my sister Mary or thought she was weird because she has Downs Syndrome. But not Ben. He always looked out for her, always made sure to pick her on his team at recess, and even made a promise to her in 4th grade to take her to the prom someday. 7 years later, he made good on that promise and in the process put a smile on Mary&#8217;s face &amp; restored my faith in humanity. Have a great time at the prom you two!</p>

<p>This is Tiernan McCready. This is what a hero looks like.</p>
<p>Last week in the Bogside he saw three males grab an 18-year-old girl and try to get her in their van.</p>
<p>Most ADULTS would be paralyzed in shock, confusion, or fear and fail to act till it was too late. Tiernan reacted instantly and shouted at the males and led the girl away to safety. He then told his mum who rang Police.</p>
<p>Let that sink in</p>
<p>This could have been the start of a potentially serious and harrowing crime. That girl could have been my child, my sister, your child, your family member.</p>
<p>The Bogside, Brandywell, and The Fountain Neighbourhood Team presented Tiernan with a PSNI Badge of Honour (and some Malteasers). But this doesn’t go anywhere near to paying off the debt our community owes this boy. Our youngsters often get a bad rep but remember the vast majority are brave and big-hearted just like Tiernan.</p>

My kids all agreed to bring in $2 each &amp; we’d buy her clothes because we couldn’t afford to get the bike. Then today, very quietly one of them came to my room with this.</p>
