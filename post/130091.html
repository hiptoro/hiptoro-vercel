			<p>We are simply in look with sausage dogs, that is what dachshunds are called by most by most people. There are small, long four-legged buddies that belong to the hunting breed of dogs. Sarah Cooper, the comedian and author did a thread on Twitter, from where we got lots of information and anecdotes about sausage dogs. The thread went viral and people started to share interesting and fun things about their dachshunds. So, without saying more, you can scroll dog to take a look at what people had to say.</p>

<p>PDSA vet Anna said that one of the most common conditions that can affect dachshunds because of their long backs is Invertebral Disc Disease, also known as IVDD, or a slipped disc. &#8220;This can lead to pain, problems using the legs, and even permanent paralysis.&#8221;</p>
<p>She also added,  &#8220;It’s also important to keep them at their ideal weight—if your dog is overweight then this also puts more strain on the back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Anna mentioned that some dog sports should not be played by dachshunds. &#8220;Certain dog sports are not a good idea for dachshunds, for example, agility and fly ball, which involve intense exertion and bending. Instead, stick to regular, gentle exercise to keep your dog fit and active (think going for lots of walks or obedience training) without putting extreme pressure on your dachshund’s spine. This is really important if your dog has had a slipped disc diagnosed—unfortunately, IVDD can happen more than once for your dog and is more likely if they’ve suffered from it in the past.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many dachshunds will be friendly towards people and other pets, especially if they have had a good start in life and been well socialized as a puppy. They can make great family pets and are often fun-loving and active. However, as they were originally bred as hunting dogs they may have a high prey drive (meaning they like to chase or catch things that run, such as wildlife) and they are often quite intelligent dogs meaning they can become bored or stressed if their brains and bodies aren’t kept active,&#8221; the vet explained</p>

<p>&#8220;A key part of helping your dog become a well-adjusted adult is their socialization as a puppy. This is the process of teaching them what to expect in life by introducing them to lots of different sights, sounds, and situations in a positive way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vet continued: &#8220;It’s also important to make sure they continue with positive, reward-based training throughout their lives. Training helps keep your dog’s mind busy and prevents them from becoming bored or getting into mischief. Try ‘brain games’ (such as ‘find the toy’ or going on a scent walk) or puzzle feeder toys which help their bodies stay active and uses their natural instinct to hunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did pressurise on that dachshund&#8217;s prey drive should not be ignored. &#8220;In terms of their prey drive, it’s really important to teach your dog recall (teaching your dog to come back to you) from a young age. Not only does this help if they see something they might want to chase, but it also helps keep them safe especially if you suddenly spot something that could be dangerous up ahead, like a road or a non-friendly dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>She continued: &#8220;Remember you need to keep rewarding them for coming back to you for their whole lives not just when they’re young so always carry some tasty treats—after all, you have to be more interesting and fun than anything else they come across! If they struggle with a really high prey drive then it’s safest to keep them on the lead, especially around livestock or other potential dangers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see what is important for you to know about your dog. Take them for a walk twice a day, that will be just fine for their health. Also, keep any extra food away from them for extra indulgence. Do not let them gain much weight, it can cause them trouble for them to walk, sleep,  and do normal  activities.</p>

<p>You know that sausage dogs have an elongated back. In order to make sure that their back is protected, they need to exercise. Also, don&#8217;t allow them to run up and down the stairs. Make sure they don&#8217;t jump from furniture, they can seriously hurt themselves.</p>
