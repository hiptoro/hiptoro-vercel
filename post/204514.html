			<p>Have you ever heard someone say, &#8220;stop making stupid people leaders&#8221;? I found a t-shirt with this sentence printed on it. That was a poor opening to the post. Let&#8217;s get straight to the point. Have you ever wondered how certain people get jobs when they don&#8217;t have the qualifications required? You probably have if you are like most people.</p>
<p>Internauts were asked to share when they realized that their boss was a moron who made more money than them. Many people did. Some of the most interesting answers from the thread have been chosen. Do you have any similar stories? Share them in the comments.</p>

<p>She doesn&#8217;t know that a fresh intern can demonstrate the basics of our industry on the spot. I have to explain from the beginning why we are doing it and why it is important.
