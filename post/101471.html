			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine it&#8217;s a beautiful day and you are home. You have given a nice bubbly bath to your furry friend and are planning to go on a walk with him later. You have brushed his soft and silky coat and your doggo is looking super handsome. Then you get distracted by something and later you realize that furry friend is gone. (Oh, no). Unknowingly, you had left the front gate open. You then run out to find your dog and what you see next totally blows your mind. Your furry friend is totally safe but is dirty because he is playing in the mud. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many other situations when your pup might get all muddy and messy while playing in the mud. To show why you should never allow your furry friend to play out in the mud, we have collected some adorable pictures that you might relate to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">P.S. The pictures below are too cute to handle. Also, you might want to adopt a pup if in case, you don’t have one. If</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you want to adopt a pup or volunteer at any shelter house, read the interview with the Central California Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</span></p>
<h2>#1 Before And After Playdate</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101503 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-1-71.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="628" /></p>
<h2>#2 As Expected I Got Super Super Muddy And Had A Great Time. However, I Partied A Bit Too Hard</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101504 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-2-69.jpg" alt="" width="695" height="399" /></p>
<h2>#3 Dog Playing In River Evolves Into Supermodel</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101505 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-70.jpg" alt="" width="697" height="431" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We talked to one of the members of Central California SPCA, Walter Salvari. He says that animal lovers can contribute a little bit to any shelter house to make things easier for the pups and other animals. “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is not a ‘best way’ to support a shelter since everyone has different abilities, availability, talents, and resources. However, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">everyone</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can help a shelter.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also told us that people can do a lot of things to help the shelter animals. Like, they can adopt a foster pet, donate some items, donate money, or any other thing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides this, people can also do other things like sharing positive and good stories about the shelter house to encourage pet adoption. </span></p>
<h2>#4 Dandelion Zoomies</h2>

<h2>#5 Before And After Mud Bath</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101507 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-5-64.jpg" alt="" width="686" height="1294" /></p>
<h2>#6 Jude And His Hound Dog Puppy &#8220;Chicky-Dog&#8221; After Playing In The Mud</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101508 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-6-66.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="873" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are living in California, there is good news for you. Walter told us that there is no specific qualification required to volunteer at CCSPCA. He says that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have tasks ranging from dog walking and animal socialization to cleaning; customer service to office work; community education presenting to fundraising, and assisting with special events.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We have positions for all levels of physical ability and our current volunteers range in age from 8 to 75,” Walter explained that people of all ages are pitching in and helping animals out. “People wishing to volunteer need to complete a volunteer application on our website and attend an orientation/training class before beginning. We also accept groups for one-day projects.”</span></p>
<h2>#7 &#8220;Today I Discovered Mud Puddles. Best. Day. Ever&#8221;</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101509 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-7-69.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="899" /></p>
<h2>#8 Our Babies When They Play Too Much. Alice And Figo</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101510 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-8-68.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="988" /></p>
<h2>#9 So That’s How Chocolate Labs Are Made</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101513 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-9-67.jpg" alt="" width="696" height="485" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When telling about what is the process of adopting a pet, Walter says that CCSPCA and other such organizations conduct a screening process. This is done in order to know whether the person has any experience with the dog breed he wants to adopt or not. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We do this to make sure they are breed knowledgeable, and not adopting simply due to the breed being pretty, or for any negative factors. We also like to make sure that if the customer has more than one person living in the household that everyone is in agreement in adopting a pet. We prefer that everyone in the home spends time with the pet to make sure the pet is a good fit in the household.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He also says that “Lastly, we ask if the customer has dogs at home. We recommend doing meet and greets first with the potential adopters in order to not have any issues at home with their beloved pet and our shelter animals.”</span></p>
