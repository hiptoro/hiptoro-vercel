			<p>Kelly Brianne Clarkson is an American singer, songwriter, writer, and TV personality who goes by the name Kelly Clarkson. She first became well-known when she won the first season of American Idol in 2002.</p>
<p>In 2002, her first single, &#8220;A Moment Like This,&#8221; was the best-selling single in America.</p>
<p>After dating for almost two years, the singer of &#8220;Catch My Breath&#8221; got married to her talent manager, Brandon Blackstock, in 2013.</p>

<p>Clarkson met the 43-year-old music manager for the first time at a 2006 Academy of Country Music Awards rehearsal. A source says that Clarkson was very happy about getting married to Brandon.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m too happy. He’s ruining my creativity. I’m writing all this happy s—t. It’s killing me,</p></blockquote>
<p>she said before exchanging vows.</p>
<p>In 2014, they had their first child, a daughter named River. After two years, the singer had her second child, a son named Remington.</p>
<p>In June 2020, it was said that Kelly had asked her husband Brandon for a divorce.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kelly Clarkson is ending her nearly seven-year marriage to husband Brandon Blackstock.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Citing irreconcilable differences, the singer, 38, filed for divorce in Los Angeles on June 4, according to documents obtained by PEOPLE on Thursday. The papers list the couple’s separation date as ‘TBD.’</p></blockquote>
<h6></h6>
<p>In December 2021, while talking with Andy Cohen on her show about how to get the first date, the pop star joked that after her painful divorce from Brandon, she would never get married again.</p>
<p>Cohen said that he always prefers cocktails to coffee on a first date. Kelly replied,</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t know. I might be more of a coffee person. I don’t know if I’m willing to invest in an evening with you yet. I’ll be single forever.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=219950" rel="attachment wp-att-219950"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-219950" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kelly-Clarkson-Her-Ex-Husband-Reach-Settlement-over-17-Million-Montana-Ranch.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="545" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kelly-Clarkson-Her-Ex-Husband-Reach-Settlement-over-17-Million-Montana-Ranch.jpg 1000w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kelly-Clarkson-Her-Ex-Husband-Reach-Settlement-over-17-Million-Montana-Ranch-300x164.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Kelly-Clarkson-Her-Ex-Husband-Reach-Settlement-over-17-Million-Montana-Ranch-768x419.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p>The talk show host also said that she isn&#8217;t very good at seeing &#8220;red flags&#8221; in people and gives them more chances even though they don&#8217;t deserve them.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m always that person that’s like, ‘Oh, I don’t know. Maybe they were having an off day.’</p></blockquote>
<p>When Cohen said that he always &#8220;cut and ran&#8221; from dates with people when he saw red flags, the Stronger singer made a joke:</p>
<blockquote><p>We should hang out, so that rubs off [on me].</p></blockquote>
<p>A source said in March 2022 that Clarkson had finished her divorce from Brandon and was ready to start a new part of her life.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kelly is obviously happy to have the divorce finalized,” as revealed by an insider. “The kids have always been her main priority through everything. She truly is able to begin the next chapter of her life with her kids, and she’s also busier than ever with her career. She’s in a great place.</p></blockquote>
<p>The former couple agreed to share custody of the kids, but the kids will mostly live with their mother in Los Angeles, where she has a house.</p>
<blockquote><p>Kelly always worked so hard and is a great mom. She is very relieved that the divorce is settled. She just wants to be with her children.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The Kelly Clarkson Show host agreed to give Blackstock a one-time payment of just over $1.3 million, as well as a monthly child support payment of $45,601, which began on Feb. 1,</p></blockquote>
<p>per source.</p>
<p>According to another source,</p>
<blockquote><p>A judge declared Clarkson legally single this August, but the case remains ongoing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last year, the 40-year-old musician talked about her relationship with Blackstock on the Love Someone with Delilah podcast. Kelly said she didn&#8217;t have any regrets about it.</p>
<blockquote><p> I regret nothing. Even unfortunate things that happen in your life or hard things, ’cause we can do hard things.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>But also I feel like that’s what shapes you, it’s what makes you a better person, it’s what makes you recognize: OK, I missed those red flags, I missed that, I ignored that on purpose,</p></blockquote>
<p>she said.</p>
<blockquote><p>I mean … I’m just collecting them,</p></blockquote>
<p>she joked.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was apparently wanting to do some kind of exhibit with a lot of them.</p></blockquote>
