			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having fun and playing with stuffed toys knows no age and a 20-years-old dog is proving this thing. This furry angel is Tessa and she is avoiding giving up on the stuffed toy even at this age. That’s the spirit, cutie pie!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tessa in fact, loves her stuffed banana toy so much that she would not trade it for anything. </span></p>

<p>“I found it in a clearance bin at a pet store, but I knew it was the size of the toys she likes. She immediately took the banana the moment I gave it to her,” Loren told us.</p>

<p>“She wants people to acknowledge it before they leave. And when she leaves it, she puts it on the bed that she thinks is best,” said her mother.</p>

<p>“We ask the guests to tell her they saw her banana so she can lie down. She has never allowed it to be a ‘toy’. It is her little possession and it is her life,” the mother added.</p>
<p>She may be 20 years old but she’s still a puppy inside.</p>
