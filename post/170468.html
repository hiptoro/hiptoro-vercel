Fifty Shades of Grey.</p>
<p>It’s a movie about a guy who was ab$#ed perpetuating the cycle of abuse with the thin veneer of “it’s okay because he’s rich and this is how BDSM works.” The f%^k it does; almost all the characters are all sh$^ty people. Period.</p>

13 reasons why. Not a movie, but is basically plays to the fantasy of any teenager who’s thinking of harming themselves how everyone will run around afterwards trying to piece it all together and they’ll still be a big part of peoples lives when they’re gone.</p>
<p>The sad reality is that this is not true and it’s a terrible message to give to kids.</p>

The whole Twilight series. Edward and Jacob are both controlling pricks at best, and Bella is too spineless to put them in their place.</p>
<p>&#8220;My love dumped me, so I&#8217;m going to engage in reckless behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My love is dead, so I&#8217;m going to commit su&amp;%#de by cop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My love is in a relationship with someone else, so I&#8217;m going to try to force myself on her so she will change her mind.&#8221;</p>

The Sex and the City Movie… and series. Big leaves Carrie time and time again over the years. This teaches that if you stick around your toxic relationship the man might finally change and commit to you…even after 10 years!</p>
<p>With that said, I love SATC! Watching it in my 20’s I saw Carrie finally get her man. Watching it in my 30’s I cringe and just wish Carrie would have stayed with Aiden.</p>

40 days and 40 nights. It&#8217;s about a girl who&#8217;s a total slot but she decides to challenge herself not to have sex for 40 days. She&#8217;s doing fine until her friend makes a website about it and a being pool starts. Suddenly everyone is trying to get her in bed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile she meets this really great guy who teaches her that love doesn&#8217;t have to involve sex, you can have a great time and even be intimate without f@#king.</p>
<p>Still, she&#8217;s so horny, you guys. At the end of the 40 days, she literally handcuffs herself to a bed to keep from letting anyone f@#k her.</p>
<p>The pool is up to huge amounts of money now.</p>
<p>Then her ex boyfriend walks in. He sees her tied up, so he ra&amp;#s her. He claims the prize money and literally rides off into the sunset.</p>
<p>The s*#^ty girl is upset because her awesome new boyfriend might not accept her now that she cheated on him by being r&amp;#ed but it turns out he&#8217;s ok with it.</p>
<p>Oh wait oops I accidentally reversed the genders of all those characters.</p>

<p id="3229927" class="post-content-description text-open-list"><span class="bordered-description with-image">Revenge of the Nerds can’t even claim it’s satirical. The nerds are just as bad &#8211; if not worse &#8211; than the jocks. Yes the jocks started it by running a few pigs through their party. What the nerds do is far worse but really only at the expense of the easier targets &#8211; their women.</p>
<p>Other than the humility of losing in what is effectively a few competitions they cheat at (along with some Tigers Balm in their jockstraps), the Lambdas don’t really get revenge on the jocks, they take it out on their women.</p>
<p>First they spy on them in the nude. Then they distribute the nude photos to the school. Finally Lewis r*^es Betty Childs. All because like four girlfriends helped the jocks with the pigs?</p>
<p>And the idea that it’s okay because Lewis is good in bed is beyond disturbing. She doesn’t just accept it, she decides she’s “in love with a nerd.” That movie was written by some serious incels.</span></p>

<p>Any action movie where someone disarms someone who has a knife. Don’t try that. If possible, run the fuck away.</p>
<p>Fifty shades of grey. Shit writing aside, that’s not how you do bdsm, relationships or anything in between. It’s not romantic. It’s creepy. Why in the fuck did anyone like that movie?</span></p>

Not a movie, but the kids&#8217; show &#8220;Caillou&#8221; is fucking terrible. It&#8217;s made for kids at the age where they copy everything they see, and the main little fucker in the show crys and whines the whole time, so kids who watch it become insufferable.</p>

Pretty mild example but Justice League.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is basically that a team is nothing without their strongest member. Basically it’s contradicting the moral of what teamwork even stands for in the first place.</p>

Any movie where a couch or car door is used as cover in a firefight.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s concealment really&#8230;</p>
