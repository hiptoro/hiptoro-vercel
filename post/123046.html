			<p>Have you ever read the famous novel “The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari”? If yes, we have found a similar story of a man who quit his job and sold his prized possessions for traveling. We feel like he has got a little influenced too much. But hey, we are no one to judge because at least he is happy with his cute cat.</p>

<p>The name of this man is Rich East and his cat is Willow. They both have been traveling across Australia since 2015. OMG!</p>

<p>Before you ask, yes Rich had a permanent job, a house, and everything that a normal person dreams of. But it seems like he was not ready to get settled for something ordinary. That&#8217;s why he quit his job, sold his property, and bought a camper van. Rich and his cat have traveled 5- 0,000 kilometers together.</p>

<p>Willow is enjoying the van life very much.</p>
