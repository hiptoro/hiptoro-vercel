<h2>Britney Spears</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164492" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1-11.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="857" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1-11.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1-11-245x300.jpg 245w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>I once made a drink for Britney Spears at Starbucks (6 or 7 years ago?) and the experience left us all thinking she was an entitled diva&#8230;but with the info that&#8217;s come out in the last couple years, I realize we had it all wrong.</p>
<p>I was on bar that day and I remember glancing into the lobby and thinking, &#8220;Huh, that chick looks like Britney Spears, only older and skinnier.&#8221; She was gorgeous but looked drawn and thin, I thought maybe hungover or partied way too hard,</p>
<p>Britney is standing with her arms crossed tightly over her chest, looking at the floor, very standoffish. I call out the drink for &#8220;Dave,&#8221; she stares at it, reaches for it, then draws her hand back to her arms crossed position, some dude picks it up and hands it to her, and they leave.</p>
<p>I catch my coworker on register and say &#8220;Was that&#8230;&#8221; and she automatically begins recounting her experience&#8230;which was that when she said &#8220;Hi! What can I get for you?&#8221; the bodyguard said &#8220;Brit, what are you having?&#8221; Though she was right in front of my coworker, she gave her order to her bodyguards, and although my coworker could hear it perfectly, the bodyguard repeated it. When coworker went to write her name on the cup, bodyguard held up his hand and said &#8220;Excuse me, do not write her name on the cup. It&#8217;s Dave. My name&#8217;s Dave.&#8221;</p>
<p>My coworker was irritated because it was like she was invisible, she felt she wasn&#8217;t good enough to have direct contact with her so she had to have some sort of middle man when they were two feet apart.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;ve heard about how little advocacy Britney has over her entire life, I&#8217;m completely second-guessing my initial reaction to the experience. It seems entirely plausible now that she wasn&#8217;t permitted to interact with anybody during that outing. Extremely sad.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Alec Baldwin </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164494" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2-12.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="524" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2-12.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2-12-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Me and my sister saw Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey, and Salma Hayek on the street when we were eating lunch. They were just coming out of a car, about to go into some building next to us. We had no idea why they were together but in retrospect it was definitely because they were filming 30 rock together.</p>
<p>My sister said &#8220;OH MY GOD IS THAT TINA FEY??&#8221; and Alec Baldwin turned around and went right in her face and said &#8220;dont f*****g say that, dont speak to us, why would you say something like that? You cant speak to us, not now&#8221;. But it didn&#8217;t really end there, he yelled AGAIN at us outside his building, saying &#8220;DONT LOOK OVER HERE, TURN AROUND AND EAT YOUR FOOD, F**K OFF&#8221;. He sounded genuinely furious at us. Almost like he wanted us to yell back and start something with him. Honestly my sister was on the verge of tears, it was horribly embarrassing. Everybody knows, now, that Alec Baldwin has a history of screaming at people. But at the time we had no idea. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, my sister shouldn&#8217;t have yelled at Tina Fey like that, but the way Alec snapped was straight up scary, like he was about to physically hurt her.</p>
<p>Salma Hayek and some other lady who I didn&#8217;t recognize came over and apologized to us. She asked if we wanted her to go and get Tina and get her autograph because apparently Tina felt bad too, but we said no. She then talked to us about the food we were eating, which was mexican food, and we ended up having a brief conversation about NY&#8217;s lack of quality mexican food. She was INCREDIBLY charismatic and sweet.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Don Cheadle </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164496" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-11.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="846" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-11.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3-11-248x300.jpg 248w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
I was the a**. I saw Don cheadle at an airport and was thinking about oceans 11 and said to my friend &#8220;dude it&#8217;s Bernie Mac&#8221; and he looked back and said &#8220;no I&#8217;m the other black guy from oceans 11 but at least you liked the movie&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="heading">Whitney Houston </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164498" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4-10.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="529" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4-10.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/4-10-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Not my story but a coworker’s story. Let’s call her Holly. Holly was a flight attendant many years ago and on one flight Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown were in first class. Holly was going through taking drink orders and politely asked Whitney Houston if she would like something to drink but didn’t get an answer. So assuming she didn’t hear her, Holly asked her again if she would like something to drink. Whitney Houston looked out the window with a disgusted face in response. Bobby Brown then said to Holly “uhm, she doesn’t speak to the help”. Then ordered for her.</p>
<p>IMO if you’re flying commercial, you are not hot s**t. I cannot fathom the level of arrogance it takes to think people are so far below you that they are not deserving of being spoken to by you.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Diana Ross </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164500" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-11.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="880" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-11.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/5-11-239x300.jpg 239w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Diana Ross. I worked in a health club in a hotel across the street from a stadium when I was young. She came in, looked at the pool (which was a really decent lap pool) and said, &#8220;My bathtub is bigger than this.&#8221;. I replied, &#8220;Go back to your bathtub then.&#8221;. She wanted me fired instantly. HR told me to go home for 2 days because if they fired everyone she wanted fired, the hotel wouldn&#8217;t have any staff.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Chevy Chase </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164502" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6-12.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="762" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6-12.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/6-12-276x300.jpg 276w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
I used to work in a posh hotel in Canada (vague on purpose) and I had met many many famous people during my time there. Most were forgettable interactions honestly, but one stands out as the absolute worst. Chevy Chase. He is a trash human being. He was totally miserable and insulting to all the staff, and we treated him with nothing but professional respect and courtesy. If I ever meet him again I&#8217;ll tell him to his face what a colossal piece of s**t he is. I can&#8217;t watch his movies since. For the record the best celebrity guest for me was Dave Grohl. He&#8217;s an awesome guy.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Tiger Woods </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164504" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-12.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="621" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-12.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/7-12-300x266.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Met tiger woods when I was 15. He slapped my hat out of my hand. A different golfer whom I didn&#8217;t know ran up, picked up my hat and asked if his signature would be ok. I agreed but I don&#8217;t know who he was or what his name was but my grandpa was pleased upon seeing it.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Our Local News Anchor </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164506" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-11.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="523" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-11.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/8-11-300x224.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
He expected my seat on a plane, he was our local news anchor.</p>
<p>Actually said, &#8220;I may look familiar?&#8221;</p>
<p>I said, &#8220;You&#8217;re a merchant banker?&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="heading">Jared Leto </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164508" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9-11.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="556" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9-11.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/9-11-300x238.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Jared Leto. Hit on my girlfriend at the time, and called me fat. His brother Shannon was super nice though.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Jared Leto </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164510" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10-9.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="684" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10-9.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/10-9-300x293.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p id="3145368" class="post-content-description text-open-list"><span class="bordered-description with-image">Jared Leto. I worshipped him as a teenager, mainly from seeing him in Requiem for a Dream and My So-Called Life and his band. But he was the most pretentious and arrogant person in real life. Never meet your heroes.</span></p>
<h2>Jared Leto</h2>
<h2 class="heading"></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164512" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11-10.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="791" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11-10.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/11-10-265x300.jpg 265w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Jared Leto. I sat next to him on a flight from Monterey, Mexico back in 2018. Absolute A**hole</p>
<h2 class="heading">David Carradine </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164514" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12-8.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="806" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12-8.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12-8-261x300.jpg 261w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
I have the perfect combination of bad star/good star. It was at DragonCon, maybe 2005? I&#8217;m going through the big autograph room, waiting to get David Carradine&#8217;s autograph. He looked so mad. He didn&#8217;t say a word as I told him how much I enjoyed his work. OK&#8230;I get it&#8230;maybe he was having a bad day.</p>
<p>Next to Mr. Carradine was Marc Singer, star of Beastmaster, V, etc. Mr. Singer is smiling, talking to people as they go by; he looks genuinely happy to be there.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a woman behind me stumbled and dropped a huge stack of materials she wanted autographed. Mr. Carradine looked down on her like she was a bug. Marc Singer jumped over his table and started helping the woman pick up her things. Didn&#8217;t hesitate one moment, just started helping.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when I decided that if I ever became famous, I was going to try to be like Marc Singer, not David Carradine.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Prince Andrew </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164516" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13-9.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="703" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13-9.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13-9-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13-9-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/13-9-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Prince Andrew, spent a lot of time around him about 10 years ago, as working at private social events he attended. The guy is a total prick.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Will Ferrell </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164518" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14-8.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="667" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14-8.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/14-8-300x286.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
I met Will Ferrell at a movie premier for a holiday movie, after the movie premier there was a meet and greet, and the actors were lingering on the main floor. I introduced myself just to tell him what’s up and that I enjoyed the movie. He looked at me with a side glance, and stated “get away from me.”</p>
<p>I was 12 years old at the time.</p>
<h2 class="heading">John Wayne </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164520" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/15-8.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="599" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/15-8.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/15-8-300x257.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
Not myself but my mother. She met John Wayne. My mother is very tall and has always been taller than most people. Her school was invited to meet John Wayne while he was filming a movie nearby. Each grade level was grouped together and the younger kids got to go first. My mother, who was almost as tall as her teacher in 3rd grade stepped up to Mr Wayne and he yelled at her. Accused her of moving in line with the younger kids just to see him sooner. This grown-a** man yelled and cussed at a 7 year old girl. He was an a**.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Drake </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164522" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16-7.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="669" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16-7.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/16-7-300x287.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
I wouldn’t say disappointing as I never was eager to meet him but Drake. Drake was just unprofessional and egotistical when I worked with him both times. This was before he got big big, first award show type level. He’s told me to f**k off directly and I watched his mom calm him down from a tantrum.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Kenny Chesney </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164524" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17-7.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="593" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17-7.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/17-7-300x254.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
My dad has been a radio personality for over 30 years and worked in country music for over half of it. He gets to meet celebrities semi-regularly. Apparently Keith Urban was really nice, Carrie Underwood was kind of mediocre bc he caught her right after her performance and she was tired.</p>
<p>But Kenny Chesney &#8220;puts the D in D-bag&#8221; (direct quote from my dad). Kenny promised to sign some pictures, tshirts, etc for a couple of kids who won a game through the radio. Kenny instead took a bunch of groupies into one of the back rooms of the radio station with a bottle of whiskey and locked the door. When my dad tried to get him to open the door and fulfill his end of the deal, he called the cops on my dad and he was lucky enough to get a cop who was a good acquaintance. Cop said there wasn&#8217;t much he could do other than make Kenny leave. So that&#8217;s what he did.</p>
<p>Kids never got their stuff signed so my dad gave them some coupons for free pizza. He said that after a few years other radio hosts told him they had similar encounters.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Bill Cosby </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164526" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18-6.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="771" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18-6.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/18-6-272x300.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
I s**t you not, my mom met Bill Cosby once. She said that he kept hitting on her friend.</p>
<h2 class="heading">James Brown </h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-164528" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19-8.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="949" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19-8.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19-8-221x300.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />
I met James Brown back in the 80s when I lived in Vail. The man was dissatisfied with everything and generally drunk. Absolute flip side was meeting Mr. Rogers when I was at Pitt. That man was the real deal.</p>
<h2 class="heading">Ray Romano </h2>

Ray Romano!! Met him at a carnival like 12 years ago and he was a complete d**khead. I asked someone who was within proximity if it was indeed Ray Romano, and he hears me ask then turns around and says “oh hey look it’s ray Romano” with a sarcastic tone and my father said “you don’t have to be rude” and his reply was “your kid doesn’t have to talk to f*****g strangers either, good job dad” and he walked off just babbling bull***t to himself. Kinda s****y since I spent some years watching his damn show.</p>

Scott Disick and Kourtney Kardashian, we met them in Cancun, they were snobby and stuck up (this was right after Mason was born), they had no interaction with Mason and the nanny did everything. They were SUPER offended that not everyone at the airport knew who they were.</p>

James Franco, though I technically didn&#8217;t meet him but sat in on a panel he did at a film festival. I was in HS and was at the festival with 3 friends, when we got word he was doing a Q&amp;A about one of his movies that thad just come out and we got really excited. We waited over an hour to get in to see the panel.</p>
<p>We were let into the room where we waited another 45 min for him to show up. When he did show up boy looked ROUGH. It was almost 4pm and he looked beyond hung over. His clothes were dirty, he obv hadn&#8217;t showered, and he spent more time talking to the floor than anything else. But the cherry on top? His ego could have filled the room. Every question that was asked he made into a story about how great he was, both actor, director, and producer. I do think some of his stuff is funny, but he&#8217;s a B actor at best.</p>
<p>I remember clear as day some woman asked him to describe a role that was &#8220;challenging for him and how he over came it&#8221; he just laughed at her.</p>
<p>The Q&amp;A ended up being so boring I fell asleep in my chair. 0/10</p>

Bill Nye the science guy.</p>
<p>I was on a field trip in middle school and our teacher saw him. She politely asked if he could say something to us or just say hi- we always watched him in science class. He told her to f**k off and basically berated her for bothering him and asking him to speak to a bunch of kids.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if he was just having a bad day, but it was not the best experience as a child.</p>

Justin Bieber. This was circa 2009-2010ish. He had a meet and greet for a select number of fans (mostly teenage girls) in which I won tickets through the radio. As a 14 year old girl OBSESSED with JB I was so excited to be in the same room and take a picture with him. He was incredibly rude with every question asked and when it came time to take pictures he said no one was allowed to talk to him. His demeanor totally rubbed me the wrong way but his concert later that night was amazing so I decided that he may be a s**t human but he is a damn good performer.</p>

Met Kevin Kostner and Clint Eastwood when they were filming near Austin. I was waiting tables. Kostner was a jerk. He did do some stuff that waiters hate. Like shaking his glass for a refill. With attitude. Stuff like that. Especially in a situation where I gave them their own space and no competition for my service.</p>

Bill cosby, before all his rapeyness was publically known. He came to the restaurant in dc where I was a hostess. I came to get him for his table and he said &#8220;did you need a college degree for this job?&#8221; Erm, no, man. Have you never met a server before?</p>

Reggie Jackson. He was a childhood idol of mine.</p>
<p>I got the opportunity to get a photo with him at some booth at a trade show called “Internet World” years ago during the dot com boom. No one was in line to get pictures with him so I walked up to get a photo while he was apparently trying to get the girls in the next booth over to sleep with him.. He acted all bugged that I asked for a photo, even though that is what he was hired for and rolled his eyes.. I guess he thought I c**k blocked him by just showing up in line to get a picture. I tossed the picture in the trash once I got it. Later that day I got a ball signed by Steve Garvey who was super nice. He replaced Reggie Jackson as my hero that night.</p>

Bobby flay, we paid hundreds of dollars to go to a fancy event he was participating in. Waited for a long a** time to just meet him and say hi, he looked at us and walked away. Was a d**k about it too</p>

Will Smith was a total a**hole when I met him at least. I didn’t say anything to him but he openly ignored anyone who just wanted to say hi and had this attitude of a “oh I’m richer than you”.</p>
<p>It was at a football game for one of kids. He acted snobby, walked in front of people, didn’t say excuse me, acted like he owned the place. Didn’t really cheer or say anything either. Maybe I caught him on the wrong day or something and he’s probably a nice guy but that was my one and only experience with Will Smith.</p>

Bill Nye. Meet him when I was like 10 years old. He was a complete a**hole</p>
