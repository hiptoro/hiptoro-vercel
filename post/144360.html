<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how hard you set the rules, your dog won’t follow them. Wait, you don’t believe that? Well, no worries because we got proof. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Catherine Morris’ family adopted a dog and they made it clear he will be a downstairs dog. But their English springer spaniel named Spike had other plans. </span></p>
<p>“The first night we had him, we closed the stair gate and went to bed,” Morris told The Dodo. “He whined for a couple of minutes before jumping over the gate in the dark and trotting up into my parents’ room and straight up <a href="https://www.thedodo.com/daily-dodo/dad-tucks-in-the-dog-he-didnt-want">onto the bed</a>! And that&#8217;s where he slept from then on.”</p>

<p>“He loves to snuggle up and tries to push his way under the covers to get as close as possible,” Morris said.</p>

<p>“This new schedule started while I was away at university, so my parents spent alternate nights downstairs with Spike,” Morris said. “Since I moved back home, I&#8217;ve joined the rotation so all in all we get a bit more sleep between the three of us.”</p>

<p>“They&#8217;re absolutely inseparable,” Morris said. “My dad calls him ‘old bean’ and they&#8217;re always chatting away.”</p>
<p>“My dad will also bring Spike his water and food to the sofa and feed him by hand to make sure he gets his medicines and keeps his strength up,” she added.</p>
