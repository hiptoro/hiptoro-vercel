			Cat Visits The Beach For The First Time And Has Very Strong Opinions About It

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every pet is different and only a true pet lover knows this thing. Like others may think that all the cats or all the dogs are the same. But it’s only when you start living with one, you come to know about their unique and out-of-the-world personality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is what happened with the little Pumpkin’s family when they took him to the beach. Pumpkin is a ginger cat and he, along with his brother, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moustachio, had gone to the beach. Since this was their first-ever trip, they were very excited. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, during the trip, Pumpkin&#8217;s family came to know that their precious Pumpkin is madly in love with beaches but strongly hates strong wind. And the reaction is clear on his face. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scroll down to check out the pictures. </span></p>
<h2>At first, Pumpkin enjoyed the beach quite a bit</h2>

<p>“The first day my daughter and I brought him to the beach, the wind picked up and he started to make faces. We had never seen anything like it before. So we took a quick video. The beach pictures all came from a 5 seconds video! He has since been back to the beach and likes it very much,” his owner told.</p>
<h2>But then the wind started to pick up</h2>

<p>“Pumpkin was so captivating from the beginning. He is so curious, charming, adventurous and so very intuitive. Pumpkin also loves all other animals and they love him too. He seems to be so connected to all living things,” <span style="font-weight: 400;">his owner further added.</span></p>
<h2>And it became absolutely obvious that he’s not that into it</h2>

<p>“We decided to foster a mom and 4 kittens from a local animal shelter. After that, we instantly fell in love with them all, but we just couldn’t let Pumpkin go. We knew he was special right away. And thus, we adopted him, along with his brother Moustachio as they were inseparable.”</p>
<h2>The photos capturing Pumpkin’s disapproving looks were posted on Facebook and it currently has over 11k likes</h2>

“Pumpkin has a mild case of Cerebellar Hypoplasia, and it affects a part of the brain which controls his motor skills. It makes him clumsy at times. It affected his coordination as well as depth perception,” the owner explained.</p>

“We’re overwhelmed with all of the love for Pumpkin. It’s crazy how fast his pictures went viral. Fans have made so many memes, it seems his face is very relatable!” the owner expressed her gratitude. “He has such a colorful personality, our friends and family kept telling us ‘make him a Facebook page!’ So we finally did on Oct 11th of this year. We love him so much and he brings our family so much joy, we’re happy we can share him with the world.”</p>
