			<p>In her BBC documentary &#8220;Planet Sex,&#8221; Cara Delevingne has given some pretty outlandish ideas about sexual intimacy. However, her most recent one may be the one that causes the most trouble.</p>
<p>Over the course of the six-part series, the 30-year-old supermodel looks at a wide range of sexual topics. Delevingne talks about a lot of different things, from sexual fluidity to the details of orgasming, and she doesn&#8217;t skip any steps.</p>
<p>Even though a lot of what she writes is based on the stories and memories of other people, she sometimes comes to conclusions that are supported not only by stories and memories but also by scientific evidence and statistical data.</p>
<p>In one episode, they talk about the &#8220;orgasm gap,&#8221; which is a term for the difference between how sexually satisfied men and women are. Delevingne says that men don&#8217;t have the &#8220;right tools&#8221; to make women sexually happy. This is a term for the fact that men and women don&#8217;t have the same level of sexual satisfaction.</p>

<blockquote><p>I do feel that generally men are not equipped with the right tools to be able to handle women, especially sexually,</p></blockquote>
<p>she says.</p>
<blockquote><p>For me, the earliest ideas I ever got taught about sex were man plus woman, d*** plus vagina equals orgasm.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to go into the art of making a woman c**, but it&#8217;s just a lot more complicated and a lot more fun,</p></blockquote>
<p>the former Victoria&#8217;s Secret model adds.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>This is because research has shown that only 65% of straight women experience an orgasmic feeling during sexual activity, while 95% of heterosexual men do. This shows that there is a big difference between men and women when it comes to how sexually satisfied they are.</p>
<p>But this unfairness didn&#8217;t just affect heterosexual women and men. It also affected gay women and men. It also affected people who were not gay.</p>
<p>Lesbian and bisexual women have a lot more orgasms than straight women.</p>
<p>Forbes says that one reason for this could be that men don&#8217;t know enough about the female anatomy, especially the vulva.</p>

<p>Even though the numbers don&#8217;t show it, it seems like Delevingne&#8217;s words made some people feel uneasy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ah, hmm, If she needs tools Iâ€™m not sure a manâ€™s whatâ€™s sheâ€™s looking for,</p></blockquote>
<p>wrote one user.</p>
<blockquote><p>IM AS GOOD AS ANY WOMAN HONEY,</p></blockquote>
<p>added another.</p>
<blockquote><p>When youâ€™re being hyped up as an intellectual but youâ€™re just a feminist in 2022 and promiscuity is the norm&#8230; imagine thinking men could be the only problem but ignoring that maybe is also a female issue, failure can go both ways,</p></blockquote>
<p>said a third.</p>

<p>The Life in a Year actress talked about her sexuality in another episode of the documentary series. She said it&#8217;s still hard for her to say out loud that she &#8220;loves women.&#8221;e.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m on a very personal journey into my own sexuality. You may or may not know I have had relationships with both men and women,</p></blockquote>
<p>she explained in a voiceover.</p>
<blockquote><p>But I still struggle with being open &#8211; really open &#8211; about just how much I love women.</p></blockquote>
<p>Delevingne goes on to say that there was a lot of shame surrounding the topic:</p>
<blockquote><p>I grew up with a lot of shame is thinking, this isn&#8217;t normal, this isn&#8217;t human.</p>
<p>Sexuality is a spectrum and mine wavers, but I&#8217;m probably, definitely more on the side of women. I like having sex with men, I just don&#8217;t date them. I might though, you never know.</p></blockquote>
