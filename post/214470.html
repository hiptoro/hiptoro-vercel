			<p>She&#8217;s about to head to the bank.</p>
<p>A hot waitress at Hooters is making a lot of money because the restaurant&#8217;s customers are so kind. But the reason she gets such big tips isn&#8217;t that she has pretty knockers. Instead, it&#8217;s because she&#8217;s pregnant.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna do another day in the life as a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@taybbitxh/video/7111860198335073582?_t=8WRdeXBIRDP&amp;_r=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pregnant Hooters girl</a>,” said pregnant waitress Tay B, 21, in a swinging TikTok clip about the amount of money she earned in tips on a random Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>In her cashflow video, which has gotten an amazing 3.3 million views, the bun-in-the-oven brunette brags about making more than $400 from customers. Customers probably went to the chicken shack to see the employees&#8217; big breasts rather than their big bellies.</p>

<p>“Tuesdays are usually our slower days…So, I don’t expect to get a <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/01/28/hooters-waitress-slammed-for-being-ungrateful-for-small-tips/">whole lot of money</a>, but hopefully it’ll still be a good day,” Tay said at the start of her post.</p>
<p>She then went on to say that the total bill for her first customer of the day was $20.83. But Tay says that when it was time to pay, the man gave her a $100 bill and told her to &#8220;keep the change.&#8221; This meant that he left her a tip of $79.17.</p>
<p>After that, the happy soon-to-be mother listed the different amounts of tips she got from customers. Some of her &#8220;regular&#8221; customers left big tips, like $40 on a $9 bill, which made her very happy. There was one &#8220;regular&#8221; customer who left the tip.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-214471" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pregnant-hooters-girl-tips-04-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1477" height="2560" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pregnant-hooters-girl-tips-04-scaled.jpg 1477w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pregnant-hooters-girl-tips-04-173x300.jpg 173w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pregnant-hooters-girl-tips-04-591x1024.jpg 591w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pregnant-hooters-girl-tips-04-768x1331.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pregnant-hooters-girl-tips-04-886x1536.jpg 886w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pregnant-hooters-girl-tips-04-1181x2048.jpg 1181w" sizes="(max-width: 1477px) 100vw, 1477px" /></p>

<p>And her day&#8217;s earnings went through the roof after she served a table of 35 people, who all gave her generous gifts of money, like a $120 tip. This meant that she had made a total of $600 for the day.</p>
<p>At the end of her video, Tay said that she had made a good amount of money: $417.</p>
<p>“[It was a] pretty freaking amazing Tuesday!,” she gushed.</p>
<p>And the people who use TikTok agreed.</p>
<p>“…Girl you are a rockstar for <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/09/29/woman-reveals-strange-interview-process-at-hooters/">serving while pregnant</a>! Those people better tip good,” praised a cyber spectator.</p>
<p>“Waitressing while pregnant isn’t for the weak… GO YOU!,” exclaimed another.</p>
<p>And another person who works in the food service industry agreed that customers are more likely to leave bigger tips when they see a big baby bump.</p>
<p>“I made more tips bartending while pregnant than not pregnant,” said a commentator. “It helps.”</p>
