<p>Would you believe if I tell you that surprise meetings do happen with the animals also? Yes, you heard me absolutely correct. This incident happened while a regular walk. These two little dogs met each other during the walk and recognized each other.  Their owners shared some pictures of this reunion on Twitter.</p>
<h4>The user shared photos that show the two sibling dogs happily hugging each other on the road</h4>

<p>They were so happy to see each other that they hugged on the road. The moment of joy was captured and somehow we can see love finds its way itself.</p>
<h3>Wanna know the whole of it from the beginning?</h3>
<p>Libby Pincher recently shared photos sent by her dad, whose business partner Dave was out walking his one-year-old cockapoo Monty in Ayecliffe, County Durham when he spotted fellow dog owners walking a similar-looking dog. And rest was the moment to be captured.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em>Happy to see you again!</em></p>
<p> Owners were surprised by the fact when they started talking and realized that they were from the same litter, but were separated when they were adopted by different families. Isn&#8217;t it so much wonderful to meet your sibling after being separated?</p>
<blockquote><p>“My husband Lee and I took Rosie for a walk one day and bumped into David. Aw, it was so lovely, they both just jumped up and hugged each other, it was amazing, they remembered each other after 10 months of not seeing each other,” remembers Susan Killip. “I took some photos and sent them to Jean and that was the last I heard of it until Jean rang me to say David had sent them to a friend who sent them to his daughter Libby and the next thing we know they were on Twitter and, as you know, it’s just gone crazy from there.”</p></blockquote>
