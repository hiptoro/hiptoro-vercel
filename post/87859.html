			Couple moves to Thai Island and adopts 15 strays after losing their Doggo
		  </h1>
			<img src='https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/couple.jpg' />
			<p>We all have a soft corner for our little canine friends in the corner of our hearts. And that is why we try to do all the possible activities to show our love for them. Also, the little doggos become a special part of our families, once we adopt them. And we strive hard to fill the vacant space that is created once they are gone. A couple too after losing their beloved 10-year-old dog has experienced the same feeling. Thus, in the remembrance of their little pet, they have adopted 15 strays.</p>
<p>This couple has become the best friend of stray dogs living in Koh Kood Island. They moved to Thailand six years ago. And since then, they are taking good care of these little dogs. The Lithuanian couple, Mantas and Rasa drive 40 km every day to feed these strays, give them medicines, and do regular checkups. As there are no vets on the island, they have to take extra care of the stray dogs.</p>
<p>We know that after knowing a gist, you might be interested to know more about their story. So, we have curated their whole story below. Scroll down and have fun!</p>
