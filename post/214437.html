			<p>It&#8217;s both satisfying and fun to work in the creative field. Through paintings and other forms of artistic expression, you can show deep meanings and talk about how you feel. You may have seen some illustrations on the Internet recently that are full of great ideas. No matter what kind of experience or feeling the picture shows, we can all relate to many different parts of those things in our own lives.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the London-based artist Yaoyao Ma Wan loves to show in her work the funny and happy parts of having a dog in your life. In each drawing, she draws a picture of herself and a picture of her dog. It&#8217;s a great example of how wonderful life can be when you have a dog as a friend, as well as how beautiful it is to have a dog.</p>
<p>Anyone who has a dog will be able to relate to the situations shown in the illustrations because they show what a dog owner does every day. Check out the amazing work of this very talented artist, which you can see here.</p>

<p>Without these little dogs, something important would be missing from life. Even if you have a lot of wonderful people in your life, you may still feel like something is missing sometimes. Because you need someone who will listen to you without talking over you or who will be there for you when you&#8217;re having a hard time.</p>
<p>The fact that these babies aren&#8217;t there gives the impression that life is boring and pointless. The best thing about having a dog is that they won&#8217;t judge you in any way, even if you aren&#8217;t particularly attractive, popular, or wealthy in the traditional sense. The best thing about having a dog is this.</p>
<p>The way the artist shows how much she loves and cares for her dog makes anyone feel lucky to have a four-legged friend. But if you don&#8217;t have any yet, the pictures in this article will probably make you want to get some.</p>
