			<p>Hearing our friends curse for the first time was liberating when we were younger.</p>
<p>It freed us up to a totally different reality where we could put ourselves out there utilizing those equivalent &#8220;filthy&#8221; words that would make our mothers break out the extraordinary cleanser assuming they heard us utilizing them.</p>
<p>As we got older, our own desire to curse probably waned, but our friends did. I&#8217;m pretty sure we all have at least one friend who&#8217;s maintained their colorful vocabulary into adulthood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Science shows that those people make the best friends.</h2>

<p>One study claims that people who swear a lot are more likely to be of higher intelligence than the average person.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>They were more likely to have a heightened vocabulary.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-200217" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FjzB4W1KtMSye4iMxFC5.jpg" alt="" width="567" height="569" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FjzB4W1KtMSye4iMxFC5.jpg 240w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FjzB4W1KtMSye4iMxFC5-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FjzB4W1KtMSye4iMxFC5-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" /></p>
<p>Mom tried to prevent us from making good friends by telling us to stay away from the kid who swore all the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Timothy Jay is a psychologist from the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts. He&#8217;s the author of the study, &#8220;Why We Curse: A Neuro-Psycho-Social Theory of Speech.&#8221;</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-200219" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Scientists-Say-People-Who-Swear-A-Lot-Actually-Make-Better-Friends_2.gif" alt="" width="664" height="664" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Curse words have been only of brief passing interest to psychologist[s] and linguists,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The absence of research on emotional speech has produced theories of language that are polite but inaccurate. Curse words are words we are not supposed to say; hence, curse words themselves are powerful.&#8221;</p>
<p>He has a point. Sometimes swearing can make you feel good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>People who curse are more trustworthy and genuine according to a study by Jay and Janschewitz.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-200222" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Scientists-Say-People-Who-Swear-A-Lot-Actually-Make-Better-Friends_3.gif" alt="" width="649" height="649" /></p>
<p>A study found a correlation between a person&#8217;s tendency to swear and their innocence. Isn&#8217;t that the kind of friend you want in your life, people who cuss more often were found to be more honest?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>There is a study that claims our friends are less violent.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-200218" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/g6JojBHluq4TjGwht7uH.gif" alt="" width="612" height="612" /></p>
<p>Adrianus Vingerhoets released a <a href="https://www.academia.edu/9877052/Swearing_A_Biopsychosocial_Perspective">study</a>. Those naughty words help us convey our emotional responses to certain topics according to a biopsychosocial perspective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>We can tell if we&#8217;re angry, sad, or frustrated without resorting to physical violence.</h2>

<p>That&#8217;s not a bad quality to have in a bestie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Jay and Janschewitz said that cursing is an essential element in understanding the link between what we say and how we behave.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-200220" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/VywpESB180UEnhcMFzJJ.gif" alt="" width="693" height="364" /></p>
<p>Swearing doesn&#8217;t mean those individuals don&#8217;t have a lot of vocabulary. They like to get to the point quickly because the opposite is true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>There are a lot of studies that show people who are smarter, happier, healthier, calmer, and better at dealing with pain.</h2>

<p>Make sure you keep those people in your life. Try to make your own speech better.</p>
