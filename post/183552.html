			<p>Humpback whales are one of the biggest whales. Gigantic in fact. An average fully grown Humpback adult whale weighs around 36,000kg, which is equivalent to the weight of 24 adult hippos. But the weight didn’t stop the massive mammal from putting on an incredible air display. In the video, you&#8217;ll see the enormous mammal that leapt completely out of the water in South Africa recently.</p>
<p>The footage was shot by Craig Capehart, a scuba diver who was sitting in a “rubber duck” inflatable boat on the coast of Mbotyiwhent in the Indian Ocean.  The graceful giant made up its mind to make an appearance. the scuba diver estimates the whale weighed to be around 40 tons, but it mattered nothing in comparison to the sight of the graceful giant. “It seems that never before has a recording been made of an adult humpback whale leaping entirely out of the water! A very rare event, indeed,” wrote Craig in the caption accompanying the video. “Dolphins and even Great White Sharks have been seen flying out of the water, but this is a first for an adult humpback whale!”</p>
