			<p>At some point in our lives, we all get to know that all those fairy tales and cartoons that entertained were not real. And we could not see them ever. The super cartoons that played with fire, the ones who flew high in the sky, and those who jumped on mountains were all fictional. But what if we tell you that we have found a Pokémon, living on the Earth? Haha! We must be kidding, right. But, if you have a look at this golden possum, you&#8217;ll surely trust us.</p>
<p>This adorable baby was found in Australia and people are highly convinced that she is Pikachu. A rescuer in Melbourne brought this poor possum to the Boronia Veterinary Clinic. And the little animal lit up the room with her golden fur. Now, you&#8217;re probably thinking that our whole life was a lie. And, this animal actually comes from the Pokémon species.</p>

<p>But, hold your horses! This golden possum possesses yellow color due to the mutation that lowers the level of pigment, melanin in its body. We know that you&#8217;re quite curious to know more about the golden possum. So, let&#8217;s have a look at the complete story.</p>
<h3>This rescued brushtail golden possum went viral for her incredible orange-yellow coat</h3>

<h3>The clinic in Boronia announced the news about their special resident on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boroniavetclinic/">Facebook</a></h3>

<p>A passerby found this eye-catching possum laying on the ground. Most likely, the little one had fallen on her mother&#8217;s back or worst, she had been abandoned. The animals that lack pigmentation have to face a lot of obstacles in the wild. Their, inability to camouflage makes them easy targets for predators. And that is why their families usually reject them. Thus, we believe, Pikachu might have faced the same situation.</p>
<h3>And there are more of these cute little creatures, the great golden possum.</h3>

<p>On talking to Dr. Stephen Reinisch at the Boronia Veterinary Clinic and Hospital, we were assured that the little golden possum was now in safe hands. We pray for Pikachu&#8217;s great life ahead! If you also liked the little bundle of joy, do let us in the comments sections below.</p>
