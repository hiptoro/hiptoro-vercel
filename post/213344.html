			<p>It is abundantly clear that Curtis Jackson III, better known to the majority of us as 50 Cent or Fiddy, is in no way, shape, or form even remotely close to resolving the conflict he has had with his son for a number of years.</p>
<p>After making the assertion online that the monthly child support payment of $6,700 that his father made to his mother was insufficient, the eldest child of the New York native, Marquise Jackson (also known as 25 Cent), has come under fire for his statements.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of his famous father&#8217;s &#8216;Broke&#8217; Instagram photo, Marquise posted an image of his own to the same photo-sharing platform, with the cash he was holding spelling out the word &#8216;Entitled.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since y&#8217;all think $6,700 is sooo much money someone tell my pops I will pay him $6,700 for just 24hr of his time so we can do everything I ever wanted to do with him as a kid [&#8230;] Red Yellow Green whatever color he like,&#8221; Marquise captioned his image.</p>

<p>Fans of hip-hop and rap are well aware of the feud between the two artists, which has been going on for many years. As a result, this information was not surprising to them. In point of fact, 50 Cent discussed their highly publicized beef on Instagram Live in order to promote his upcoming book, Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter, which is scheduled for release in the year 2020.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sad situation. When you pray for success, you don&#8217;t necessarily pray for the things that come with it. It&#8217;s no such thing as success without jealousy without envy or entitlement,&#8221; the father-of-two said.</p>
<p>He confessed that despite the fact that he had forked over close to $1.5 million in child support to his son, Marquise&#8217;s mother had instilled in him a feeling of entitlement in his upbringing, saying: &#8220;His mom developed an entitlement that cannot be met, filtering that energy through his actual personal interests [&#8230;] So, while being a privileged child, he feels deprived.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rapper known for his hit song &#8220;In Da Club&#8221; also casually mentioned during the live performance that he &#8220;used to&#8221; love his son but that he clearly did not feel the same way about him any longer.</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think that success would cost me my firstbornÂ but it&#8217;s the situation it is. Like, my grandfather used to say, &#8216;If it rattles like a snake and slithers like a snake, is it a snake or do you need to be bit?'&#8221;</p>

<p>Around the time of his Instagram Live, Fiddy made the comparison between his then-23-year-old son and the rapper 6ix9ine, who has rainbow-colored hair and is widely considered to be the most reviled man in rap as a result of his cooperation with authorities to reveal his role in a violent drug-trafficking gang known as the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods. Fiddy&#8217;s son was only 23 at the time of the comparison. It is common knowledge in the rap community that he is a &#8220;snitch&#8221; and a &#8220;rat,&#8221; both of which are derogatory terms that he has since come to embrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;He better than Marquise though. I&#8217;ll take him before I take my actual [son],&#8221; 50 Cent stated,Â <a href="https://www.distractify.com/p/why-does-50-cent-hate-his-son">Distractify</a>Â detailed.</p>
<p>The son of the person who is 47 years old provided the following response: &#8220;Did he just say he would claim a rat? Aww nah, I want no part to that cheese. I don&#8217;t know what y&#8217;all got going on over there. That&#8217;s some other s**t. Stupid!&#8221;</p>

<p>Prior to their beef, 50 Cent had always spoken highly about being a father and being there for his son, whom he shares with his ex-girlfriend Shaniqua Tompkins. Shaniqua Tompkins and 50 Cent have a son together. &#8220;When my son came into my life, my priorities changed, because I wanted to have the relationship with him that I didn&#8217;t have with my father,&#8221; he said, perÂ <a href="https://www.distractify.com/p/why-does-50-cent-hate-his-son">Distractify</a>.</p>
<p>50 Cent and his ex-partner got into a heated argument after their breakup with Tompkins because they could not agree on how to divide their property and how much child support 50 Cent should pay. As a consequence of this, 50 Cent disclosed in an interview in 2014 with Philly&#8217;s Morning Show with Shamara and Laiya that his son had regrettably &#8220;embraced his mom&#8217;s perspective on me,&#8221; which had the effect of straining the relationship between the two of them.</p>
<p>Regarding Marquise&#8217;s offer of $6,700, 50 Cent has not yet provided a response that is available for public consumption.</p>
