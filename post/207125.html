			<p>Haters won&#8217;t get the better of Donna D&#8217;Errico.</p>
<p>After trolls informed the 54-year-old Baywatch star she was &#8220;too old&#8221; to wear a two-piece swimsuit, she took to Instagram to pose in a little pink bikini.</p>
<p>She replied snarkily to everyone who had criticized her for showing off her physique in the caption.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for all the comments on my other post. I read them all. In no way am I anywhere near perfect but I’m feeling pretty damn good,&#8221; D&#8217;Errico wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;I took a little break and drove across America with my dog. This country of ours is beautiful. I never knew just how beautiful until I drove across it and took the time to appreciate it,&#8221; she continued, adding: &#8220;Have an awesome day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The former Playboy model previously attacked her detractors in a post when she once more appeared in a bikini.</p>
<p>She referenced a video she posted over the Fourth of July weekend in the description of the picture. &#8220;Quite a few women complained about the 4th of July video I posted in a red white &amp; blue bikini.&#8221;</p>
<p>D&#8217;Errico continued by recalling some of the insults she had heard, writing: &#8220;They thought I was &#8216;classier than that&#8217; and &#8216;too old to wear a bikini&#8217; and, my favorite, &#8216;desperate.'&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me tell you something that might surprise you. I can actually wear and do literally whatever I want. On that note, here is me in a bikini squatting on a coffee table,&#8221; the actor added.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>Fans responded to the star&#8217;s posts with an outpouring of affection and encouragement. Many people praised her handling of her critics in the comments area.</p>
<p>One wrote: &#8220;You are the most beautiful woman in the world, I love your personality and the way you deal with any hater, I admire the strength and courage you have!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another added: &#8220;Good for you. Haters will hate,&#8221; while a third chimed in: &#8220;You look absolutely stunning as always! I’m glad you and your pup enjoyed your vacation!&#8221;</p>
