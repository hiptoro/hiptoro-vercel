			<p>Although it is most common to have a child between our second and fourth decade, there are times when the miracle of life can surprise us in old age. A doctor in Argentina married a woman 48 years younger than him and became a father at the age of 83.</p>
<p>Life still has a lot to offer in old age. We want to tell you the story of this man, who decided to start a new family as a senior, with a philosophy of living that demolishes all prejudices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A life devoted to improving the health of a country.</h2>

<p>He is the most famous nutritionist in Argentina. Thousands of people with eating disorders have been helped by his treatment institutions, educational activities, and media messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pure love knows no age or prejudice.</h2>

<p>His personal life came into the public eye when he announced that he was going to marry a woman who was 48 years younger than him.</p>
<p>Their first child was born in 2021. The doctor said that he and his wife agreed that their child wouldn&#8217;t eat any salt or sugar for the first 2 years.</p>

<p>When it was learned that he was about to have a little orphan, some journalists wondered how long he would be present in his son&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>The couple remained strong in the face of criticism, as they both were convinced of their decision and no one was going to take away their joy. “Everything people have talked about this week, we already talked about 3 months ago. I didn’t ask myself the question (about age), I’m asking it now, since people have started to mention it,” the doctor <a href="https://telefe.com/ph-podemos-hablar/imperdibles/alberto-cormillot-cuando-mi-hijo-nazca-a-la-noche-voy-a-dormir/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">said</a>.</p>
<p>She is aware that one day he will not be around, but she is ready to face it. “They don’t say anything that I don’t know, or that Alberto doesn’t know, or that we haven’t talked about. I talked about it with my friends and they told me ’Yes, it’s going to happen, you’re going to have a child, and tomorrow he won’t be there, for logical reasons of life. And when he is no longer there, we will all be there to take you forward’,” she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5BzlqisodE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">confessed</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On September 17, 2021, the couple&#8217;s dream came true when the baby, named Emilio, was born in perfect condition. They went home to start their new adventure.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-198700" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/472e3f5983b314cd054c2f24a5.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="466" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/472e3f5983b314cd054c2f24a5.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/472e3f5983b314cd054c2f24a5-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>

<p>After the birth of his daughter, Reneé, and later his son, Adrin, Cormillot knew what it was like to be a dad for more than 50 years. The amount of time that passed between the birth of his last child and the new one made him feel like a first-time father.</p>
<p>“I don’t remember much of what the experience is anymore. Yesterday we went to look for strollers, so we did a course on strollers. These didn’t even exist back then, they used to be much more primitive. Before there were cloth diapers that were washed and changed, and today it is totally different,” he <a href="https://tn.com.ar/show/novedades/2021/06/20/la-reflexion-de-alberto-cormillot-en-el-dia-del-padre-mi-viejo-me-hubiese-dicho-te-parece-tener-un-hijo-a-los-80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">said</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the years that separate them, his children have accepted his decision about his new life and his baby brother. “My son said that he will have someone to play catch with, and having a brother is something he will like. And Reneé, as a female child, is ambivalent. On the one hand, she’s happy and on the other hand, it’s hard for her,” he said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Old age is a new possibility to do it all.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-198699" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/0e2b9451b59cc86946c49ed98a.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="522" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/0e2b9451b59cc86946c49ed98a.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/0e2b9451b59cc86946c49ed98a-300x215.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A child is 83 years old. It is true that old age can be lived in a positive way, and that society has a negative view of it.</p>
<p>“People are biased with respect to an older adult, there is a cliché: an older person cannot have children or have fun [&#8230;]. A single-parent family can have a child, but not an elderly person. It is not a very wise thing to do. Senior citizen is an overload, they are disposable, disposable, not even recyclable, and many people buy that. And I don’t buy it and I didn’t buy it,” he <a href="https://www.lanacion.com.ar/espectaculos/personajes/alberto-cormillot-sobre-su-paternidad-a-los-82-anos-hay-un-cliche-sobre-los-adultos-mayores-se-los-nid18032021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">said</a>.</p>
<p>His way of dealing with age is remarkable even though he has been beaten down. He does aerial dancing and tap dancing. “I had cancer twice, which is a disease associated with older people, and the X-rays show that my knees are shot, as are my shoulders and spine. In total, I’ve accumulated more than 30 injuries. There seems to be a contradiction between my medical history and my life because you see me and realize that I do the same things I’ve always done,” he <a href="https://noticias.perfil.com/noticias/informacion-general/alberto-cormillot-y-el-fenomeno-viejenials.phtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">said</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He wants to live to be 105 so he can see his son graduate. “I won’t be able to be like a young man of 30 can be, that’s for sure, but I’ll do what I can do,” he said regarding his reality, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB-GTFx1jqI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">added</a> that he left a very special gift for when Emilio is older: “I got him a phone with a line and I send him WhatsApp messages and record stories, send him photos and tell him what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>Do you think having children at an advanced age is good or bad?</p>
