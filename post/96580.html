			12 Dog Breeds That Have Changed Drastically Over Years

			<p>Animals have known to live beside humans. Some breeds have become massive with time while few have not so much.</p>
<p>They can be compared on the basis of their appearance. We collected a few pictures of some dog breeds that have changed beyond recognition because of human influence.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dachshund</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-96581 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/5945965687b8b8afbd1a97d4fd.jpg" alt="Dachshund" width="728" height="262" /></p>
<p>These dogs have a longer face and body, a slightly wider chest, and much shorter hind legs.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rottweiler</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-96582 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4e350d552b8f105a4c03022e88.jpg" alt="Rottweiler" width="728" height="296" /></p>
<p>Modern Rottweilers are black in color with well-defined reddish-brown spots on the face, cheeks, under the eyes, on the lower part of the chest, and on the legs. The fur is coarser now, and they don’t have their tails docked anymore.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Airedale Terrier</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-96583 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/bf0b105727b350d7a259242182.jpg" alt="Airedale Terrier" width="728" height="292" /></p>
<p>This breed almost hasn’t changed except for becoming ‘shaggier’ and longer in the face.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Saluki (Persian Greyhound)</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-96584 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/066fc759769f1eb658f451861f.jpg" alt="Saluki (Persian Greyhound)" width="728" height="312" /></p>
<p>The Salukis have become a lot taller and thinner. Now they have long and very thin legs, as well as longer ears.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>German Shepherd</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-96585 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/26e85b598d8f10532f57f685c5.jpg" alt="German Shepherd" width="728" height="316" /></p>
<p>The German Shepherds have become larger, and their fur has become longer and thicker. The skeleton has changed as well: now the сroup is lower, and the chest is wider.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bull Terrier</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-96586 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/abeb0b5a8aa4be13e24d43da25.jpg" alt="Bull Terrier" width="728" height="290" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Doberman Pinscher</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-96587 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/739ad25c0fa70c1c45dcc52c4d.jpg" alt="Doberman Pinscher" width="728" height="316" /></p>
<p>These dogs have become a little less massive, and their head is more smooth now. By the way, they are not as aggressive as they used to be years ago.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>English Bulldog</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-96588 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/beb3655d8baaf24106f718da54.jpg" alt="English Bulldog" width="728" height="316" /></p>
<p>This dog has become more massive and stockier. The chest has become wider, the legs have become shorter, and the face is more flattened now. The Bulldog also has more skin hanging on its body. Unfortunately, modern Bulldogs suffer from a number of health issues, and the average life span of the breed is six and a quarter years.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Boxer</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-96589 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/c5399a5a5b995bf328d83a2533.jpg" alt="Boxer" width="728" height="316" /></p>
<p>The Boxers have shorter and upturned faces now. The proportions of the body have slightly changed too.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Basset Hound</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-96590 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/c6517b5aa2ade225a3a78cd40a.jpg" alt="Basset Hound" width="728" height="285" /></p>
<p>The body of the Basset Hound has become lower, the hind legs are shorter, and the ears are a lot longer now. The face, like the legs, has become shorter, and the skin has more folds now.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Irish Setter</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-96591 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/30833c5cd7acbc412c94b4672a.jpg" alt="Irish Setter" width="728" height="286" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>West Highland White Terrier</strong></h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-96592 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/36e4e35a62b145f79d69d57b9c.jpg" alt="West Highland White Terrier" width="728" height="316" /></p>
<p>The fur might have become a bit longer and thicker in this breed.</p>
<p>And they seem to adopt themselves with the evolution.</p>
