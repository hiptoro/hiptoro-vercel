			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, it&#8217;s really hard to accept that there are people who don&#8217;t love dogs. It’s sad to realize that some people can never understand what it feels like to live with a dog. And it’s unfortunate to know that some people are still treating these furry angels like objects. We not it’s not fair because dogs are best and humans are worst. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully, humanity is not dead yet. It&#8217;s because an NGO called Proyecto 4 Patas helps injured dogs to get better. What this NGO does is it takes mistreated animals, give them treatment, and find a loving family for them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We promote an attitude of respect towards all living animal species and support an ethical premise that they are sentient beings and not objects to be used by humans. We reject all kinds of animal exploitation including their use as clothing, food, entertainment, or for experimental purposes,&#8221; says the organization on their website.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This organization told us about its main objectives. </span>&#8220;To strive against animal abandonment, mistreatment, or the suffering of any animal (for use as clothing, food, entertainment or experimentation) to educate people about respecting animals&#8217; lives through the presentation of talks and workshops run in both public and private locations. Running free or reduced-cost sterilization campaigns in marginalized areas. Promoting the belief that a mass sterilization campaign which is systematic, extensive, and free is the only ethical method to control pet overpopulation and urging the government to implement such a program. Aiding animals in need, providing treatment and recovery, and facilitating adoption to responsible owners. Provide legal advice to residents involved in cruelty cases. Promote veganism as a philosophy which liberates animals from suffering.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, this organization is also taking action to stop animal cruelty. What they are doing is educating people about stray dogs. The NGO is telling them why it is necessary to desexing male and female stray animals before their first heat. Besides this, the NGO is also requesting the government to organize more and more desexing programs. </span></p>
