			<p>Don&#8217;t we all love seeing sweet <a href="https://www.theanimalclub.net/wildlife/9820/">nature photos,</a> which capture a perfect moment that helps bring us closer to nature?</p>
<p>Like one photographer, who captured a “once-in-a-lifetime moment” of a bird bathing <a href="https://www.theanimalclub.net/wildlife/photographer-captures-pic-of-two-bees-cuddling-together-on-a-flower/">in a flower petal</a> in a beautiful photograph.</p>

<p>Singh’s Instagram, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rahulsinghclicks/">@rahulsinghclicks</a>, is full of pictures of birds of all sizes and colors.</p>
<p>But many of the most striking photos are of birds enjoying the local plants and flowers.</p>

<p>And last year, he captured one of his most memorable photos after observing some very unique, rare bird behavior.</p>
<p>“I visited a place where there were bushes of these ornamental bananas to take photos of sunbirds sucking nectar from it,” he told added.</p>
<p>“Everything was going as usual when, suddenly, I was shocked that the crimson sunbird started taking a bath in the water stored in the banana flower petal.”</p>

<p>Here is another image from the series where Crimson Sunbird female refreshing herself with the water which is stored in the petal of an ornamental banana flower as if nature creates a floral bathtub for her. In this particular image, she posed as if she has poked her beak into the flower.</p>

<p>Amazed, he quickly captured a series of photos of the bird cooling off in the dew. He wrote that it was “as if nature creates a floral bathtub for her.”</p>
<p>The bird certainly looks like she’s enjoying herself. The photographer explained on Instagram that the bird could probably use some cooling off on a hot morning.</p>
<p>“In India, the Autumn days are hot and humid but the nights are pleasant,” Singh wrote. “In the morning, dewdrops are found on the edge of the grass, flower petals, and sometimes water is stored in the flower petals.”</p>

<p>Singh took plenty of photos. He had never seen anything like it and knew it was a rare opportunity.</p>
<p>“I was literally stunned to see this unusual behavior,” he told The Dodo. “I kept my camera’s shutter button pressed as the bird took her bath.”</p>

<p>The photos of the crimson sunbird’s bath have now gone viral and are Singh’s most popular photos on Instagram.</p>
<p>It just goes to show how nature can surprise and amaze us if we just stop to look at the flowers.</p>
<p>“This was really a once-in-a-lifetime moment,” Singh said. “It’s amazing how nature can surprise us.”</p>
