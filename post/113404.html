			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People keep dogs, cats, ponies, raccoons, spiders, ants, and many other animals as pets. But have you ever heard anyone saying that they have a beaver as a pet? We are sure you haven’t heard anyone. And do you know why? It’s just that beavers are so hard working. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Confused? Okay, so the thing is that if you ever keep a beaver as a pet, it will constantly keep cutting woods. And who knows it might even start building a dam. No, we aren’t joking. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, we have come across a story of a cute beaver that has built a dam in its rescuer’s home. This beaver has used literally everything that he found lying in the house from pillows, tissue boxes, buckets, plungers, and everything else. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scroll down to check out this great story. </span></p>
<h2>Ever wondered what it’s like having a beaver around the house? Well, it’s very much them living out their instincts</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113405 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-7.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="904" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-7.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-7-232x300.jpg 232w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This adorable beaver was rescued from the side of the road where he was abandoned. At that time, this beaver was just 3 weeks old. Nancy is the one who has rescued this beaver named, Beave. She thinks that the parents of this cute little beaver might have got killed. Otherwise, they would not have left this baby on the side of a road. </span></p>
<h2>Meet Beave, a rescue beaver who has been taken in by a wildlife rehabber until he’s ready to go back to the wild</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113406 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-7.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="843" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-7.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2-7-249x300.jpg 249w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>And, no matter where he is, he does what beavers do best—build dams, of course!</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nancy is a licensed wildlife rehabilitation specialist. She has helped many such abandoned animals in the past. But the thing is that beavers are a little different from other wildlife animals. Till the time beavers are with their parents, they literally learn EVERYTHING from them. </span></p>
<h2>Beave was picked up from the side of the road when he was just 3 weeks old</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113407 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-7.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="866" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-7.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-7-242x300.jpg 242w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-7-445x552.jpg 445w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>It is speculated that Beave’s parents were killed by poachers and Beave was simply abandoned at the road</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113408 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-7.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="797" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-7.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/4-7-263x300.jpg 263w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>According to the rehabilitation program, he’ll stay with the wildlife rehabber for around 2 years</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Nancy even shared a video. In that video, she was saying that she wants Beave to eat solid food. Although Beave has started eating, he still needs to be fed by hand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, Beave is in rehab and is planning to stay there for the next 2 years. While he is there, he will do what he is best at, i.e., building the dams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Beave is just starting to the dam with household objects, but has not yet started outside or in water,” elaborated Nancy. “He dams pretty much every evening. When I clean it up, he just rebuilds!”</span></p>
<h2>Videos of Beave building ‘dams’ at home using various household objects have begun surfacing</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113409 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-7.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="915" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-7.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/5-7-230x300.jpg 230w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>His dams involve everything from pillows to metal racks to plungers to anything else he gets his paws on</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-113410 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-7.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="812" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-7.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-7-259x300.jpg 259w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dams that Beave has built is not any normal dam. It’s because this dam is made of pillows, tissues, and everything else that came on the way of this little beaver.</span></p>
<p>“The most challenging part about rehabbing a beaver is trying to teach him to learn all the things his parents would teach him. He does chew everything in the house, but with each rehab, there are unique challenges.”</p>
<h2>Beave has his very own TikTok channel with over 370,000 people following his daily shenanigans</h2>

<h2>If given enough time and items, Beave is sure to leave a messy pile of random stuff in the doorway</h2>
