			<p>A few days ago, a Reddit user who worked as a videographer for a big company shared his experience, and almost everyone paid attention to what he had to share. The Redditor confessed how he used to work a lot in a toxic work environment and still get very less pay for his job.</p>
<p>Even after being in a toxic workplace for a long time, the videographer did not give up and kept on pushing himself. “How I managed to do it for 6 months is beyond me, especially for how shitty I was paid.” But eventually, the time came, when he got frustrated with his work life and had to call quits with the firm. After making this decision, he felt really happy and regretted that he could do it much sooner.</p>

<h2>After getting fired from his toxic workplace, this Redditor who worked there as a videographer discovered that the company has still been using his work</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191120005080/en/New-Survey-Reveals-Toxic-Cultures-and-Negative-Behaviors-Are-Prevalent-in-the-Workplace" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A report</a> from Everfi found that people have been dealing with negative stress because of their work-life and that it is very common. With a whopping of 54 per cent of respondents saying it is prevalent, along with high rates of a toxic culture. Similarly, there were many other reports stating that people have been suffering from toxic workplace environments and 47 per cent of respondents said they want to quit their job for a place with “better working conditions.”</p>
<p>The signs not only included toxic behavior, disrespect, distrust, and resentment. It also involved egregious conduct like harassment, bullying, discrimination, and more that are still very prevalent in workplaces today. Sometimes, it’s the overall negative vibe that seems to penetrate the office which often lingers for many years to come.</p>
<h2>So fed up with the whole thing, he deleted thousands of hours of work</h2>

<p>If you ever feel that you&#8217;ve been trapped in a toxic workplace, there are some ways in which you can pull yourself out of it. So we initiated a conversation with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marilynstarkloff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marilyn Starkloff</a>, a marketing coordinator and content strategist who told us that the most important thing is that, you gotta trust your gut. “If you used to like what you do but now you only dread it. Does your workplace bring out the worst in you? Do you drive to work thinking about all the different ways you can crash your car? Then it’s time to say your goodbyes and find a new job,” she said.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, while it can be an overwhelming experience to get out of. People did not take time to admit that they took a right decision to get out of a toxic place This is what happened to Marilyn. “I regret not leaving sooner than I did. It was not until covid when I was on furlough for those few months, I realized while I was no longer working at that job, my mental and physical health improved tremendously. I squandered five years at a horrible workplace because I couldn’t stop thinking about all the ‘what ifs’ and was afraid of quitting.”</p>
<h2>Don’t let the fear of “what ifs” stop you from leaving the toxic workplace</h2>
<p>Everyone fears of not finding a suitable job, or ending up in a workplace that has an even worse atmosphere, fear of the boss’ reaction and how it would look on their resume, are all real. But there are several things as liberating as pulling the trigger. You have to confront the “what ifs” in order to get freedom.</p>
<p>“Learn to put yourself first, not your boss. We only have one life, so make the most of it by surrounding yourself with people that love and support you. Don’t let fear and ‘what ifs’ rule your life; instead, take action,” Marilyn said to anyone who’s struggling in a similar situation right now.</p>
<p>She further added: “I understand that circumstances are tough, and that leaving your hostile/abusive workplace isn’t easy. There are ways to cope, like I did over the past five years. I strongly advise you to use these approaches only when actively looking for a new employment.”</p>
<h2>And this is what people commented on this whole situation</h2>
