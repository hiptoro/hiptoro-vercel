<h2>You might remember a story about a guy who found a cat (not his) who snuck into his home to give birth</h2>

<p>The name of this man is Paris Zarcilla and he is a London-based film director and writer.</p>
<h2>Well, this is them a couple of years later, celebrating their two-year anniversary as a lovely family</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-125714 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-4.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="502" /></p>
<h2>For those unaware, in 2018 Paris Zarcilla walked into his room to find a stray mama cat who’d birthed 4 kittens</h2>

<p>“Happy Birthday my fam. I love you more than you’ll ever know. You’ve brought so much light to my life. You have me forever. X #Caturday #TwoYears,” read the tweet.</p>
<p>Throughout his entire Twitter account, the cats are seen hanging around on the window sill, sleeping, sniffing about (food and other things), being curious, box fun, among many other cute, hilarious and exciting cat things. When you have five cats, activities for them are numerous.</p>
<h2>He ended up giving the entire cat family a forever home and posting regular updates</h2>

<h2>One of the bigger updates was their two-year birthday last May and their Christmas together a month ago</h2>

<h2>Needless to say, the <em>pawmily</em> has grown a lot since Paris’ first adventure with them</h2>
