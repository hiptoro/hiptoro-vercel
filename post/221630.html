			<p><em>Game of Thrones</em> is a highly decorated television series. For years it has not only entertained us but given us memorable storylines. One aspect of this captivating show was the incest aspect. However, it is now revealed that the script becoming a reality. <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/shes-disgrace-of-a-mother-cardi-b-slams-casey-anthony-ahead-of-new-docuseries/">Singer-songwriter</a> Lilly Allen, the real-life sister of Alfie Allen who plays Theon Grayjoy, was offered a role. She had to play the role of Theon&#8217;s sister. But the storyline had an incest moment between the two characters and <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/kit-harington-guest-appearance-on-netflixs-criminal-in-first-major-tv-role-since-game-of-thrones/">Lilly Allen</a> denied the role in the <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/watch-avatar-2-online-when-is-the-james-cameron-movie-going-to-come-on-hbo-max-disney-netflix/">HBO show</a>.</p>
<p>The character in the discussion is Yara Greyjoy was originally played by <span class="yKMVIe" role="heading">Gemma Whelan. However, the producers wanted Alfie&#8217;s real sister, Lilly, to play that role. Once she understood what the scene was, she backed out. In a Reddit post, Lilly explains, &#8220;</span><span class="js-subbuzz__title-text">I&#8217;ve been asked to do a <i>Game of Thrones</i> cameo, they asked me if I&#8217;d be interested in playing Theon&#8217;s sister, and I felt uncomfortable because I would have had to go on a horse and he would have touched me up and shit. </span><span class="js-subbuzz__title-text">Once they told me what was entailed, I said no thanks,” she went on. “I would be open to doing a musical cameo like Sigur Ros, though.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>She has since gone on to slam nepotism in the industry in a series of tweets. She wrote, &#8220;I promise you I’m not rooting for an industry full of people that had childhoods that looked like mine.I just really think that we can’t get to a real solution without identifying the real problem, as fun as it is to laugh at the kids of famous people. Nepo babies have feelings.&#8221; She continued, &#8220;I do feel that nepo babies are being somewhat scapegoated here though, there is a wider, societal conversation to be had about wealth inequality, about lack of programs and funding, and I guess that was the point I was trying to make, maybe badly.&#8221;</p>
