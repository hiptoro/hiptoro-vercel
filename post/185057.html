<p>How can one calm their dog&#8217;s gown for a photo? Toronto-based <a href="https://www.poshpetsphoto.com/toronto-dog-photography-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pet photographer Karen Weiler</a> revealed her tricks on how to take the perfect picture with pets. One of the most useful things was to have your favorite toy or treat near the camera lens. The camera will have its attention. She further explained,  “As a professional dog photographer, my secret weapon is that I can make the highest pitched sounds you can imagine—sounds that always elicit laughter from the humans and the crowd-pleasing favorite, the head-tilt, from the dog.”</p>
<p>In the next few photos, you will see how some people managed to get their dogs&#8217; attention but not in the most ideal way.</p>
