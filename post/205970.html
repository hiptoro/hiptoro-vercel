			<p>If you are a parent, you probably remember the days when your kids were not in school. Maybe you are in that phase right now. Babies and young toddlers who are not potty trained need to be changed right away, especially if it is number 2. You have to find a place to change a baby&#8217;s diaper when you&#8217;re out. Changing tables are provided at many stores, restaurants, and even theme parks. If you are a woman, you will probably see a changing table in every public restroom. It can be found near the sinks.</p>
<p>It might be different if you are a dad. The men&#8217;s restroom has a changing table but the women&#8217;s restroom does not.</p>
<p>A dad shared his experience with changing tables. He explained that he “was at a large store yesterday with my 5mo son when he did what babies do.” He took his baby to the bathroom.<br />
There was a women&#8217;s restroom and a men&#8217;s restroom. There wasn&#8217;t a family restroom.</p>
<p>He went into the men’s restroom and discovered that “there was a cubicle and a few urinals, but no changing table. The sink didn’t have a counter either.” He didn&#8217;t have a place to change his baby&#8217;s diaper, so he asked a store employee for help. The employee escorted him back to the same restroom he had just come from after assuring him that there was a changing table. He went inside again. Nope. There is no changing table.</p>
<p>The only other thing he could think of was to check the women&#8217;s room because he knew he needed to change his baby&#8217;s diaper. He explained, “I give up and head into the lady’s room which sure enough had a changing table.” There was a changing table in the ladies&#8217; room.</p>
<p>There was a woman washing her hands when he entered the ladies&#8217; room. The dad explained that the men&#8217;s room didn&#8217;t have a changing table so he was only there to change his baby&#8217;s diaper.<br />
She left after washing her hands. The dad tried to change his baby&#8217;s diaper before anyone else.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>A woman walked in and freaked out before he was done. She screamed, “Get out! You can’t be here!” Then she left the bathroom. When the dad left the bathroom with his baby, he “saw the woman talking to an employee and decided to leave without my stuff. The employee tried to wave me down and stop me, but I rushed out to my car, buckled my son into his car seat, and left.”</p>
<p>The dad was trying to figure out if he did the right thing or not. His wife said he was in the right, even though his mom called him an idiot. The dad said that the store messed up by not putting a changing table in the men&#8217;s restroom. One comment reads, “That store is 100% to blame for this. I wouldn’t be shocked if they’ve received complaints about this in the past and haven’t done anything about it.”</p>
<p>The only thing the dad did wrong was to leave the store. The comment reads, “If anything you did wrong by rushing out as if you did something wrong. You should have told the employee that there’s no changing room in the men’s and that they should do something about that.”</p>
<p>If you needed to change your baby&#8217;s diaper but there wasn&#8217;t a changing table in the bathroom, what would you do? Do you think this dad made the right decision to change his baby&#8217;s diaper in the women&#8217;s restroom?</p>
