			<p>Bruce Willis was recently seen in a picture with his current wife, Emma Heming, his five children, and Demi Moore.</p>
<p>Moore posted a picture of actor Bruce Willis with his whole family in front of a Christmas tree on her Instagram account to kick off the holiday season.</p>
<p>Moore wrote the following as the caption for the picture:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are FAMILY!! Getting into the holiday spirit!</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the actor from Die Hard was diagnosed with aphasia, he has kept a low profile.</p>

<p>Due to his health, Rumer Willis said in a statement posted on her Instagram account in March that he would be leaving the entertainment business.</p>
<p>The statement said:</p>
<blockquote><p>To Bruce’s amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.</p>
<p>This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support.</p>
<p>We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him.</p>
<p>As Bruce always says, ‘Live it up’ and together we plan to do just that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Johns Hopkins Medicine says that aphasia is a language disorder that is caused by damage to a part of the brain that is responsible for both speaking and understanding language.</p>
<p>It makes it hard for someone to talk to other people, and many people get it after having a stroke.</p>
<p>Some of Willis&#8217;s coworkers became worried when they saw that he was having trouble remembering his lines, according to a report. Most people didn&#8217;t know that the actor&#8217;s health was getting worse, but this event made them worry.</p>

<p>A stuntman who had worked with Bruce Willis in the past told White Elephant director Jesse V. Johnson that Willis was not the same as he remembered.</p>
<p>Johnson even said that there were times when the actor seemed very confused and unable to understand what was going on during filming.</p>
<p>He added,</p>
<blockquote><p>Someone would give him a line and he didn’t understand what it meant. He was just being puppetted.</p></blockquote>
<p>Johnson said that since the Pulp Fiction star was in such a bad state, it was decided not to make a sequel.</p>
<blockquote><p>After our experience onWhite Elephant, it was decided as a team that we would not do another,</p></blockquote>
<p>Johnson said.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are all Bruce Willis fans, and the arrangement felt wrong and ultimately a rather sad end to an incredible career, one that none of us felt comfortable with.</p></blockquote>
