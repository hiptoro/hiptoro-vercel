			<p>A Georgia mom teaches a life lesson to her son and is flooding the internet. This mom willingly pushes him to shop at goodwill as she caught her son making fun of his classmates.</p>
<p>Though parenting is fun, but not as easy as it seems to be. It takes a good heart to take such a firm step towards your kids. To make them a good human by the end of the day. A mommy took the courage to Facebook to share how she dealt with her 13-yr old son when she noticed him being cruel with his classmates.</p>

<p>She explained that he had been &#8220;acting like he&#8217;s too good to shop at Wal-Mart&#8221; and was making &#8220;snarky comments&#8221; about kids at school who shop at Goodwill. &#8220;I don&#8217;t tolerate that,&#8221; further added alongside a photo of her son as he shopped in a thrift store.</p>

<h3 class="headline" style="text-align: center;">Raising a teenager includes trying to keep up with all the latest trends</h3>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today, he took his own 20.00 to the goodwill to buy clothes to wear the entire week to school. Whatever he found is what he would have to wear. He isn&#8217;t happy and shed a few tears but I firmly believe in 15 years he will look back and laugh at the day his Mom made him shop at goodwill. I want to teach my kids that money isn&#8217;t everything and if you have to degrade other people because of where they shop, then you too will shop there. Side note, I love the goodwill!!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Forney wants his son to teach that life is much more than money and being human is above all the kindness in the world. Degrading others will never take you to success. This mom&#8217;s tough-love post has made more than 770k likes and has been shared more than 295k times.</p>
<p>The Facebook post was outpoured with unexpected and loving comments and here are some.</p>

<p>In a later post, Forney mentioned that after taking permission from kid I&#8217;d shared the post on Facebook, captioning-</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My son learned a valuable lesson from this and I believe it is just another story we can add to our lives memory to look back on. I didn&#8217;t do this to punish him. It wasn&#8217;t to show him that goodwill isn&#8217;t a good place to shop. I did this to teach him that money and name brands don&#8217;t change who we are as people. He can still be the amazing, adorable, loved kid that he is WITHOUT the expensive stores!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>She revealed that her son &#8220;shed a few tears&#8221; but she held firm in her convictions.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I firmly believe in 15 years he will look back and laugh at the day his Mom made him shop at Goodwill.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
