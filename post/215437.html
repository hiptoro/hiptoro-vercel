			<p>A TikToker seems tired of having to explain why she has 11 kids by eight different men.</p>
<p>The woman, whose social media name is PhiPhi, thinks that she has so many daddies because of &#8220;math.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some people can&#8217;t stand the thought of having more than one child, but for others, it&#8217;s clear that the more, the better.</p>
<p>PhiPhi doesn&#8217;t seem to care about the haters, and she once went viral for explaining why she has so many kids.</p>
<div class="css-c2lb2p">
<p>Taking to <a href="https://www.unilad.com/tiktok" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a>, she said: &#8220;One thing I&#8217;m sick of having to explain is why I have eight baby daddies.</p>
</div>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m gonna explain this one time for y&#8217;all so there won&#8217;t be any more questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>&#8220;If you have one and you take away one, you have zero. But if you have eight and you take away three, you still have five.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>Her explanation wasn&#8217;t very detailed, but it&#8217;s pretty clear that she doesn&#8217;t want her kids to ever be &#8220;fatherless.&#8221;</p>

<p>The comments, on the other hand, were, as usual, pretty mean.</p>
<div class="css-c2lb2p">
<p>One person commented: &#8220;Bro they ain’t <a href="https://www.unilad.com/pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon</a>. You don’t gotta catch them all.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>&#8220;The real question is how baby daddy number 6,7, and 8 allowed themselves to be number 6,7, and 8. I could never,&#8221; a second added.</p>
</div>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>Another commented: &#8220;There seems to be a lot of mathematics involved with your parenting!&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>&#8220;And did the 8th know about the 7 before him?&#8221; someone else questioned.</p>

<p>Well, as most people know, TV star Nick Cannon recently said that he is going to have his 12th child. This was reported by Entertainment Weekly.</p>
<p>In a post that showed off her baby bump, Alyssa Scott&#8217;s partner wrote: &#8220;With you by my side.&#8221;</p>
<p>One user said: &#8220;Omg, congratulations, love and blessings to you!&#8221;</p>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>Another wrote: &#8220;I knew it! So happy for you! This is such blessings!&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-215438" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/resize_6.webp" alt="" width="648" height="777" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/resize_6.webp 648w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/resize_6-250x300.webp 250w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" /></p>
</div>
<p>The exciting news comes just a few weeks after Cannon had his tenth child.</p>
<p>He and Brittany Bell already had two children together: Golden Sagon and Powerful Queen. They announced that they had had a third child, Rise Messiah.</p>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>Cannon wrote: &#8220;Another Blessing!!! As my journey on this planet becomes more and more remarkable and unfathomable, all I can do is thank God and continue to ask the Most High to order my steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>&#8220;He has given me stewardship and dominion over a family dynamic that to some is unimaginable.</p>
</div>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>&#8220;But more importantly he has blessed me with loving individuals to guide me with care through this purposeful life.</p>
</div>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>&#8220;I am so indebted and grateful for the matriarch energy in my time of need.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>He concluded: &#8220;Probably the most difficult labor and delivery I have ever witnessed!.</p>
