			<p>Have you ever torn your favorite belonging deliberately? Ah! We know that you are wondering why would one do so. That&#8217;s because we want to explore what&#8217;s inside them. Haha! Okay, you have never tried this and we won&#8217;t even recommend you to do this. But, have you ever accidentally explored what&#8217;s inside the regular things we use?</p>
<p>Personally, when we were kids, we were quite curious to know what&#8217;s in the toy that we love so much. Or what&#8217;s in the tennis ball that makes it travel through the air? And if you too were curious about them, we have got you covered. Because today in this report, we&#8217;ll tell you what&#8217;s inside all those regular things we come across. And, not only toys, we have debit cards and AirPods too!</p>
<p>So scroll down and have fun!</p>
