			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A vegetarian woman accidentally ate </span><span style="font-weight: 400">meat for the first time due to a serious McDonald’s order</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> mixup</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. She </span><span style="font-weight: 400">left &#8216;traumatised&#8217; when she had one bite of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has ordered a veggie deluxe meal. But due to some error, she was given a chicken burger in veggie wrapping at a Maccies restaurant in Corstorphine, Edinburgh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 26-year-old was left &#8216;vomiting and in tears&#8217; after </span><span style="font-weight: 400">a single bite</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">when she realized she’d been given chicken instead.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m completely traumatised from being given chicken that&#8217;s labeled as a veggie burger when I&#8217;ve never eaten meat in my life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve vomited and I still feel sick, it is DANGEROUS to mislabel food!!!&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-180742 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-46.jpg" alt="" width="848" height="1130" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-46.jpg 848w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-46-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-46-768x1023.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I immediately burst into tears and was physically sick.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was really hungry and looking forward to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I took a bite into it and then when I swallowed I realised this was not what I was expecting to bite into.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;ve never eaten meat, it didn&#8217;t really register that it tasted like meat because I didn&#8217;t know what [meat] tasted like. It tasted similar to Quorn but the veggie deluxe doesn&#8217;t taste like that.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-180743 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-45.jpg" alt="" width="848" height="636" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-45.jpg 848w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-45-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-45-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" /></p>
<p>She added: &#8220;As soon as I realised, I froze and I messaged my boyfriend saying that I&#8217;m really panicking. I asked him to check if they&#8217;d changed the veggie burger, but when I Googled it I saw they hadn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;It traumatised me. I actually got Calum [her boyfriend] to come and pick me up because I didn&#8217;t want to be on my own and I needed some moral support. He was upset on my behalf too.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dangerous. If you&#8217;re mislabelling food then it could be something someone&#8217;s allergic to. I know chicken isn&#8217;t a common allergy but as I&#8217;d never eaten it I could have been severely allergic to it. I could have been hospitalised.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to really enjoy the veggie deluxe when I couldn&#8217;t be bothered cooking but I&#8217;ll never eat at McDonald&#8217;s again. I was feeling ill the whole night and then right into the next day.&#8221;</p>

<p>A McDonald&#8217;s spokesperson said of the incident: &#8220;We recognise that it is not acceptable to serve meat when a vegetarian product has been ordered, and we sincerely apologise to the customer for the mistake that was made in this instance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a number of procedures in place to avoid inaccurate orders, but in this case, these were not followed, and we are looking into why this occurred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our Customer Services Team is currently in contact with the customer to help find a resolution.&#8221;</p>
