			<p>Being a bridesmaid was not easy.</p>
<p>If something goes wrong, it&#8217;s your job to fix it.</p>
<p>There are many tales of horrible wedding moments. The drama never ends whether it&#8217;s a bridezilla demanding ridiculous requests or expensive trips.</p>

<h2>Fringe bands.</h2>

<p>Being a bridesmaid doesn&#8217;t make you immune to craziness. The girl&#8217;s sister didn&#8217;t want anyone&#8217;s hair blowing in the wind, so she demanded that she grow out her fringe bangs. That is extra.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The sister-in-law who&#8217;s transparent.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185154" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/I9H6P9OCpKXsygvQjysL.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1440" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/I9H6P9OCpKXsygvQjysL.jpg 2160w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/I9H6P9OCpKXsygvQjysL-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/I9H6P9OCpKXsygvQjysL-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/I9H6P9OCpKXsygvQjysL-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/I9H6P9OCpKXsygvQjysL-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/I9H6P9OCpKXsygvQjysL-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I was asked to be a bridesmaid in my sister-in-law&#8217;s wedding. Mind you, I was asked only as a backup. Someone else couldn&#8217;t do it; I was asked months after everyone else. A week before the wedding, my SIL is texting my husband that he &#8216;can do better&#8217; and that he&#8217;s too good for me. I was also 7 months preggo at the time. I refused to be a bridesmaid — and she was mad at me.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mel1323" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mel1323</a></p>

<h2>The handsy mom.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-185155" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Bridesmaids-Get-Candid-About-Their-Worst-Wedding-Moments.gif" alt="" width="666" height="372" /></p>
<p>&#8220;We wore strapless dresses. I didn’t realize my bra was showing slightly above my dress on one side, so the bride’s mother put her hand up my dress and lifted [it] right up to my bra in front of everyone at the wedding to pull my bra down a little. Wrong on so many levels.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/MiaNW8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MiaNW8</a></p>

<h2>The photoshoot.</h2>

<p>The bridesmaid wanted a picture of the bridesmaids lifting their dresses to show their butt and the bride pretended to be shocked.</p>
<p>The bride delayed the rehearsal dinner because none of the girls felt comfortable doing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Food allergies.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185157" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/H9RZxEK6WkI3YHhx6wIh.jpg" alt="" width="2160" height="1440" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/H9RZxEK6WkI3YHhx6wIh.jpg 2160w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/H9RZxEK6WkI3YHhx6wIh-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/H9RZxEK6WkI3YHhx6wIh-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/H9RZxEK6WkI3YHhx6wIh-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/H9RZxEK6WkI3YHhx6wIh-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/H9RZxEK6WkI3YHhx6wIh-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I had an anaphylactic attack to the food at the wedding. Turns out, there were nuts in the chicken. I had to be taken to hospital.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/afsanahoque2000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">afsanahoque2000</a> The bride should&#8217;ve been more careful!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Stolen dress.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185158" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SEJ3eocA1V0EzGMtI3Vl.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="1008" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SEJ3eocA1V0EzGMtI3Vl.jpg 1280w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SEJ3eocA1V0EzGMtI3Vl-300x236.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SEJ3eocA1V0EzGMtI3Vl-1024x806.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SEJ3eocA1V0EzGMtI3Vl-768x605.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;My bridesmaid dress was stolen off my porch a week before the wedding. Awesome. I had to spend even more money and order a new dress. They stopped carrying the style that my friend had picked for her bridesmaids. Great. Thankfully, my friend was okay with a different style that was similar&#8230;[but] it was a close call because the dress didn’t [arrive] until the day before the wedding. After that wedding, I decided I didn’t want to be in weddings anymore.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/jessicagriffin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jessicagriffin</a></p>

<h2>The expensive trip.</h2>

<p>We introduced you to a bride-to-be who demanded that her bridesmaids pay for an exclusive trip to the Bachelorette.</p>
<p>This Redditor&#8217;s sister-in-law <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6jkf64/bridesmaidsgroomsmen_of_reddit_whats_the_most/djf2wli/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demanded the same thing</a>, saying that &#8220;I&#8217;m only going to get married once so I have every right to be selfish.&#8221;</p>

<h2>A sister-in-law who&#8217;s inclusive.</h2>

<p>&#8220;When my brother got married, I was added late as a bridesmaid — meaning, he picked too many friends, and so his future wife needed an extra girl for her side. The bride arranged for my hair to be done separately from the group&#8230;and [she] told me what time to arrive at the venue. We pulled up on time and found her and the girls out back&#8230;taking their wedding party photos without me. The marriage lasted four months before they separated, and two years later, I paid the court fees to file the divorce because my brother had yet to file.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/angies43991b35a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">angies43991b35a</a></p>

<p>&#8220;For my friend&#8217;s Indian wedding, she had the bridesmaid outfits made in India. I am a plus-sized girl, and clearly, the seamstress took my measurements as just a suggestion. It was so small! Thankfully, my sister was able to Frankenstein the top to fit me, but the pants I had to wear as is. They were so tight, I purposely wore underwear the same color because I just knew they were going to rip&#8230;which they did when I went to sit down. Thankfully the top was long and covered it the rest of the day.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/e4d1fa5d22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e4d1fa5d22</a></p>

<h2>Dyed hair.</h2>

<p>The girl&#8217;s best friend asked her to dye her hair blonde because the other bridesmaids had brown hair. She willingly agreed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The fight.</h2>

<p>&#8220;I was a bridesmaid at my sister&#8217;s wedding, and my partner at the time forgot his trousers at the hotel. [He] blamed me, resulting in an argument that I managed to diffuse, but there was still an awkward tension. He refused to dance with me so I danced with my other sister instead. I think it goes without saying that we&#8217;re not together anymore.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mychallockwood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mychallockwood</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Outdoor wedding with no backup plan on the shores of Lake Michigan. Pouring rain and wind but the happy couple requested no umbrellas because they wanted to be able to see the faces in the crowd. They were able to see the very wet and angry faces of people whose clothes were ruined while the bride and groom stayed dry under the gazebo.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6jkf64/bridesmaidsgroomsmen_of_reddit_whats_the_most/djf5kl4/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MajorMustard</a></p>

<p>Another demanding sister! The bridesmaid was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6jkf64/bridesmaidsgroomsmen_of_reddit_whats_the_most/djezlxe/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked</a> to get a spray tan for the wedding.</p>
<p>Since the wedding was on a hot day, the spray tan melted and stained her dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a bridesmaid and my SO was a groomsman, and we were banned from looking at, speaking to, or dancing with each other for fear of &#8216;out-cuting&#8217; the happy couple. We&#8217;d been together for 5 years at this point. We didn&#8217;t do it, but the request alone was outrageous.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6jkf64/bridesmaidsgroomsmen_of_reddit_whats_the_most/djf2iuk/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deleted</a></p>

<p>&#8220;The bride bought us all earrings to wear on the day. I was met with a blank look when I told her the holes in my ears were closed over a while ago.. so one of the other bridesmaids (who happens to have quite a weak stomach for this kind of thing) and I went into the other room and re-pierced my ears.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6jkf64/bridesmaidsgroomsmen_of_reddit_whats_the_most/djevd0s/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">u/LeiPewPew</a></p>

<p>The bridesmaid was kicked out of the wedding because she was pregnant and was shown in the photos.</p>
<p>She miscarried. The bride told her that she could be back at the wedding.</p>

<p>&#8220;My friend forced her entire bridal party to write a speech for the rehearsal dinner. I couldn&#8217;t enjoy the dinner, I was so nervous, but managed to sputter something out after 3 glasses of wine. Some of the others were so uncomfortable, they were either a few seconds long or had uncomfortable moments of silence.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6jkf64/bridesmaidsgroomsmen_of_reddit_whats_the_most/djezzq0/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">u/melishi</a></p>

<p>&#8220;I was told to go weed the flower beds at a backyard wedding before the guests arrived. This was after we had already taken some photos so the bridal party was dressed and ready. It was over 80 degrees out. Good times.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6jkf64/bridesmaidsgroomsmen_of_reddit_whats_the_most/djf69xz/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">u/JaneIsJen</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Bride wanted photos of the wedding party at EVERY San Francisco landmark. Four hours driving around in a limo held together with duck tape to cheese in front of each corny tourist spot. She had a videographer along with and wanted only the natural sounds recorded, so no one was allowed to talk.&#8221; &#8211; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6jkf64/bridesmaidsgroomsmen_of_reddit_whats_the_most/djf8flv/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">u/GalantGuppie</a></p>
