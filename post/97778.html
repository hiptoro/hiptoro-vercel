			<p>We have heard people saying once a puppy, always a puppy. Dogs are always puppies for their owners. But it turns out to be true. Even though the dogs have gotten big, they still act as if they are small puppies. In fact, their owners can&#8217;t pick them up. It seems as if such dogs grow in size only. Their innocence and heart are still the same as that of a puppy.</p>
<p>If we think about it, they are not asking too much. They are our furballs and they deserve the love they ask for. No matter how much they grow in size and look like a panda instead, they&#8217;ll always be our cute little puppies.</p>
<p>We have photos of some massive dogs who think they are lapdogs. Scroll down and look at the furry bears.</p>
<h2><strong>1) The elusive 180lb lap puppy.</strong></h2>
