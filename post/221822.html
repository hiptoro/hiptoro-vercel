			<p>DJ <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/stephen-twitch-boss-wrote-a-heartbreaking-post-prior-to-his-demise-aged-40/">Stephen &#8216;tWitch&#8217; Boss</a>, a familiar face who got famous via &#8216;The <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/ellen-giving-staff-millions/">Ellen DeGeneres</a> Show&#8217;, died by suicide earlier this month at age of 40. Her friend, Ellen, remembered the late DJ who was a prominent part of the show since 2010, and got emotional. She has made several social media posts remembering tWitch. She has constantly wished well for her wife Allison and his children Weslie, Maddox, and Zaia.</p>
<p>Ellen DeGeneres began the heartwrenching video by saying, &#8220;The last 11 days have been really tough for everyone. Everyone is in pain and trying to make sense of it, and we&#8217;ll never make sense of it. The best thing we can do is to laugh and hug each other and play games and dance and sing&#8230; the things he loved to do. It seems impossible, but that&#8217;s how we honor him and hug each other and tell each other we love each other and let people know we&#8217;re there for them and check in with people.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the video, she could be heard saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m supposed to be throwing to a montage right now of some of our favorite celebrity moments, but I&#8217;m not gonna do that. Over a decade ago, I met someone who changed my life — and our show. And I&#8217;m talking about you tWitch. Come here.&#8221; Ellen could be seen getting emotional and crying at the memory of her good friend.</p>
