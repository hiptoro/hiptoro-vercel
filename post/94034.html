			<p>Recently the oldest feline died at 31, Rubble. He was a fluffy Maine Coon who became &#8220;world&#8217;s oldest cat&#8221; in the world after reaching 31 years old. It is known to be equivalent to almost 150 human years in May last year.</p>
<p>Michele Heritage- feline&#8217;s owner is heartbroken, got Rubble as a kitten for her 20th birthday. She said &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;He would have been 32 in May so it was such an achievement. He was an amazing companion that I had the pleasure to live with for such a long time. I got him just before my 20th birthday when he was a kitten.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2>Michele got Rubble as a kitten for her 20th birthday, in May 1988 and they have been together ever since.</h2>
<p>Michele never had her own child but she cared Rubble like one. Her bond with him was very close to her heart. She was eager to celebrate Rubble&#8217;s birthday but he passed before reaching 32. She added further</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;He was part of a litter cat that my sister&#8217;s friend had and I had just left home. I was lonely living on my own so got him in as a kitten. It was in May 1988. I have always treated him like a child &#8211; I don&#8217;t have any children and had another cat called Meg &#8211; who passed at the age of 25. If you care about something, no matter what it is, it does last.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

<h2>Rubble &#8211; world&#8217;s oldest verified living cat. Died on July 3, 2020</h2>
<p>Rubble had no specific health issues but passed away from old age, becoming very thin.</p>

<p>Rubble is known to beat the oldest living cat record of Scooter, who died in 2016. Scooter- a Siamese Texas is a record-breaker at the age of 30 and named by the Guinness Book of World. In this note, Michele added &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;We never went down the route of Guinness Book of Records. I didn&#8217;t want to do that given his age. The record wasn&#8217;t of interest to us.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>She shared that Rubble was getting old faster at the end. She had realized that the last year&#8217;s Christmas was their final celebration with him, she told her husband. He had started to stop eating and only drank water.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;He became very thin. I went to work as usual and when I got home my husband said Rubble had gone over the road as he did every day and never came back, so we believe he went off to die as cats do.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;He was a creature of habit, had his favorite places to sleep and liked his food so when that stopped happening, we knew.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Michele puts down his longevity due to her treating him like a child as she hasn&#8217;t had her own children</h2>

<p>Michele said she remembers the exact moment that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubble_(cat)">she first met Rubble</a> and claims to be 100 percent certain of the dates &#8211; because it was her 20th birthday</p>
