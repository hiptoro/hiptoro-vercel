<p>Some internet users have been sharing interesting facts about the world. Some of the facts and tidbits shared on the r/AskReddit subreddit might blow your mind and make you see the world in a different way. Remember to upvote the facts that you found most interesting when you scroll down.</p>
<p>Steven Wooding, a member of the Insitute of Physics in the UK, as well as a member of the <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Omni Calculator Project</a> that creates cool things like the <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/conversion/weird-units" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Weird Units Converter</a>, said, &#8220;Scientists have to be curious about how the world works and persistent in their work, as it may take years for it to pay off. Creativity to imagine what might be possible and attention to detail to gain knowledge are also very important.&#8221; &#8220;We have to be open-minded to new facts and let data guide the way, rather than just what we think. On the other hand, we should also be critical of data. One experiment doesn’t make a fact. A fact comes from experiments that can be repeated and verified many times over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steven agrees that our attention spans seem to be getting shorter with the advent of platforms like Twitter and TikTok.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you feel you are time-pressured, it’s probably only natural that you don’t want to invest a chunk of time on one article but instead scan the headlines to get lots of little bits of information. I have certainly noticed myself being less likely to read a long article unless it’s something that genuinely interests me,&#8221; Steven explained that our natural interests, as well as our desire to save our time and energy limit how much attention we give to each and every bit of news we come across. Unfortunately, this means that some of us tend to stay at a superficial level.</p>
<p>&#8220;The negative impact is that we won’t reach a deeper level of understanding of something and end up missing out. This is ironic, as people today rush around trying not to miss out on things,&#8221; he explained.</p>

<p>Natural redheads have a genetic resistance to anesthesia and a high tolerance for pain. I think the latter is to compensate for the former.</p>
<p>I had a terrible fear of the dentist because they would give me the normal dose of novocaine, then think I was lying when I said it didn&#8217;t work. Fun times! When I finally found the right dentist, he took one look at me and told the tech to load up four times the novocaine &#8211; what he called the redhead dose.</p>

<p>The expert gave his take on how to avoid getting stuck in a stagnant mindset, as though we already know everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s essential to have a growth mindset and realize that you probably know very little. We can only gain more profound knowledge of the world by investing time in exploring it. This issue goes back to short attention spans, which gives us a broad, but the shallow spread of knowledge. Take the time to read a book on a subject, and you are bound to learn more,&#8221; he suggested that we find the patience to delve deeper into a subject.</p>

<p>Most people know that dogs have a good sense of smell, but I recently did some research into the full extent of it.</p>
<p>40% of the brain is devoted to smell. Unlike humans, they have a completely different organ that is designed to take in the smell and not the oxygen they breathe.</p>
<p>We can taste a small amount of sugar in our coffee. They could smell the sugar in the swimming pools.</p>
<p>A dog marked a mole on a woman&#8217;s arm. They tested it and it was negative. Due to the dog&#8217;s behavior, they decided to retest and found a small fraction of a cancer cell in the spot.</p>

<p>We should be aware that some information is spread on the internet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Red flags to watch out for that a claim may be fake: it&#8217;s outlandish, it&#8217;s too good to be true, you haven&#8217;t seen the claim anywhere else, you&#8217;ve never heard the source, the source isn&#8217;t reputable, you can&#8217;t find two other sources making the same claim, your gut tells you, ‘this can&#8217;t be true,'&#8221; Mike Sington, an entertainment, pop culture, and lifestyle expert from Los Angeles, who knows how social and traditional media works, explained to me earlier.</p>
<p>He mentioned that the reliability of information has suffered because of how popular social media has become. &#8220;The rise of social media has decreased the reliability of the information because misinformation can spread so quickly before it can be corrected,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>One way to double-check a source is to start with a simple search on the internet. Continue to be skeptical if you can&#8217;t find any more evidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do this and think before reposting or you may be contributing to the problem. Amplification doesn’t make a claim true or accurate,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The New York Times is one of the sources that the expert trusts the most. &#8220;They employ fact-checkers and editors that ensure the information they post is correct. They’re basically doing the research and homework for you. There are literally too many online sources to list that can’t be trusted and should be avoided. Anyone can basically post anything they want… proceed with caution,&#8221; the expert warned.</p>

<p>Diamonds are not valuable or rare. An international corporation that specializes in everything diamond created an advertising campaign saying that a man should spend two months of his salary on an engagement ring.

<p>Woodpeckers have tongues around their skulls to prevent them from getting concussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our attention spans have been reduced to mere seconds at a time because that’s the way information and entertainment are fed to us now. People get tiny bite-sized bits of news by scrolling a Twitter feed, they entertain themselves by scrolling quickly through Instagram and TikTok. It’s creating a habit that doesn’t have to be,&#8221; Mike warned that we’re being changed by what we consume.</p>
<p>&#8220;The good news is there’s plenty of long-form entertainment and news available, you just have to seek it out. I believe the benefit is worth it. I’ve discovered it improves your ability to focus, it’s more calming, you retain more information, and it gives you a more balanced and nuanced view of the world.”</p>

<p>I researched subliminal messaging and mental health through virtual environments for my class. Negative messages in the morning can ruin a person&#8217;s day and can affect their mood and work ethic. I found that the opposite is also true with my research and experiment. The problem is with the different brain waves as you wake up.</p>
<p>The paper was written in a senior seminar, so I don&#8217;t remember the waves exactly. The brain releases four waves depending on consciousness. It&#8217;s important to go through all four. If you look at your phone in the morning, you skip from the first to the last wave, which leaves you mentally and emotionally vulnerable.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>The opposite is true. I used a test group of 5 people who had been diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety, as well as one person who had no history of depression or anxiety. I would send a personalized text message to each of them every night at 3 am, assuring them that they&#8217;ll have a good day and that if times are hard, the best they can do is try their hardest. Had put a lot of effort into these, and every week I checked in on them, taking into account changes in their personal lives.</p>
<p>When I connected all the data, I found that people with anxiety and depression had a better work ethic and took more initiative to solve their problems. They noted that levels of anxiety were slightly lowered. He noticed a general increase in positivity and work ethic when he was a participant who had no mental health problems.</p>
<p>If you love someone who has been down recently, send them a text when they wake up. The effects take about a week to set in and end at around a month and a half in from what I saw. This is not a cure for depression and anxiety, but it is a small thing that someone can do for a loved one.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>This study has made me realize that I want to use my computer science degree to help people&#8217;s mental health, and why I decided to get my master&#8217;s in computer science and get a degree in psychology while I&#8217;m at it. It&#8217;s time someone tried to fix technology&#8217;s bad effects on mental health. I&#8217;d like to help pave the road for the guy that is, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m that man.</p>
<p>Encouraging messages to be read as soon as someone wakes up is a great way to help someone with their mental health problems.</p>
