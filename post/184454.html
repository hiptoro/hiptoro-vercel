			<h2>The love for animals can go a long way.</h2>
<p>When we receive love, we can change. Two lives can be changed by adopting an animal. The animals and your own are included in these two lives. The pet will be able to call home. They will be surrounded by someone they can call family. They will finally have someone that will love them their whole life. It is a win-win situation. What more could you ask for? Adoption is not easy.</p>
<p>Some animals are afraid of leaving the shelter. When they move to their new home, they might be afraid. They may be anti-social. The wait will be worth it when these pets come out of their shells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Here&#8217;s a beautiful story of a former shelter dog named Heaven.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184456" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/red-eyed-dog.jpg" alt="" width="1461" height="1536" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/red-eyed-dog.jpg 1461w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/red-eyed-dog-285x300.jpg 285w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/red-eyed-dog-974x1024.jpg 974w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/red-eyed-dog-768x807.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1461px) 100vw, 1461px" /></p>
<p>Heaven was adopted from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KentuckyRiverRegionalAnimalShelter">Kentucky River Regional Animal Shelter</a>. It was a huge step for Heaven. Heaven was a very shy dog and would get scared by almost anything. Heaven needed a way to get her confidence back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It was then they began their Home Depot trips.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184457" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-in-home-depot.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-in-home-depot.jpg 1080w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-in-home-depot-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-in-home-depot-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-in-home-depot-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-in-home-depot-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-in-home-depot-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>“The Home Depot runs started as a way to help her with her fears,” Rakers told <a href="https://www.thedodo.com/daily-dodo/dog-is-the-cutest-home-depot-employee-ever">The Dodo </a>in an interview. “She was nervous about new places and new sounds, so we’d go for five minutes and she’d get all the treats.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Heaven got exposed to new things as their trips to Home Depot became longer.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184458" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-wearing-home-depot-vest.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-wearing-home-depot-vest.jpg 1080w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-wearing-home-depot-vest-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-wearing-home-depot-vest-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-wearing-home-depot-vest-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-wearing-home-depot-vest-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-wearing-home-depot-vest-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Home Depot is a dog-friendly place.</h2>
<p>Heaven was very comfortable there. Heaven started interacting with people more often. She earned her own apron after some visits.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184459" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-employee.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-employee.jpg 1080w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-employee-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-employee-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-employee-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-employee-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-employee-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Heaven knows she is going to Home Depot when she is wearing an apron.</h2>
<p>“I keep it in the car so we are always ready,” Rakers said. “As soon as she can tell we enter the parking lot, she just quivers until I put [the apron] on her and then takes off towards ‘work. She walks around like she owns the place.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184460" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-in-bucket.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-in-bucket.jpg 1080w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-in-bucket-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-in-bucket-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-in-bucket-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-in-bucket-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-in-bucket-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Home Depot now has a special employee.</h2>
<p>Around the store, Heaven is well known. The staff members call her by her name and she is allowed inside the break room. It has become a second home for her.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184461" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/man-petting-dog-1.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/man-petting-dog-1.jpg 1080w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/man-petting-dog-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/man-petting-dog-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/man-petting-dog-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/man-petting-dog-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/man-petting-dog-1-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Heaven has fun with the customers as well.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184462" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-with-heaven-tag.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-with-heaven-tag.jpg 1080w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-with-heaven-tag-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-with-heaven-tag-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-with-heaven-tag-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-with-heaven-tag-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dog-with-heaven-tag-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>“She walks around minding her own business and then suddenly insists on meeting someone,” Rakers said. “She just sits and stares. They always end up saying how they needed that pick-me-up.”</p>
<p>You would think that Heaven can tell who is having a bad time so she can cheer them up. Home Depot is the best place for her to pick humans.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Heaven has regained her confidence after taking the adventure trips to Home Depot.</h2>
<p>“She was scared of everything, but with a lot of training and patience, she learned to trust, and now it’s like she pays it forward,” Rakers said. “She finds who needs her and gives them that smile and a cuddle.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s a relief for Heaven when they make frequent trips to Home Depot because they always have something to do with their home.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Look at how happy she is!</h2>
<p>It only takes a little bit of love and the right parenting to bring out the best in your fur baby. Heaven is a perfect example of that.</p>
