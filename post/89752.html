			<p>Life is all about ups and downs. But, when we go through the obstacles in our lives, they always leave us with some great lessons and messages. What we need to do is stay strong and keep holding the ray of hope. Being a parent is never easy. Many times, the parents have their kids but they realize the actual essence of parenting when their kids <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/30-pics-of-dogs-growing-up-next-to-their-owners/">grow up</a>.</p>
<p>But we go through a lot of pains and emotions while putting in efforts to become parents. Many times our friends send their kitty to our home so that we can lift up our mood. They try to help us in the best possible way because they know what we are going through. And here, we have curated 18 stories of parents who didn&#8217;t leave their hope and are leading a happy life now. So, to get an insight into those stories, scroll down!</p>
