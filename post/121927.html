Rather than build over the medieval Viking building, the store opted to include several sections of glass flooring so that the customer can have an educational learning experience.</p>
<p>Shoppers will be able to learn about the medieval past while shopping in the store. Scroll down to see what they discovered and how the store looks like.</p>
