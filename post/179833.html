			<img src='https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/adoptedsiblings.jpg' />
			<p>Katie Page after her marriage ended in her 30s decided to start a new chapter. She decided to foster a child after moving into a new home in Colorado. She was interested in adopting despite her fertility issues.</p>
<p>A caseworker told her about a baby who was dropped off at the hospital.</p>
<p>The court terminated the rights of the birth parents. On Grayson&#8217;s 11 month birthday,Â  Katie adopted him.</p>
<p>She wanted to wait another couple of years to bring another child into her home because she loved being a mother.</p>
<p>One month after adoption, another caseworker called her about a dire situation. A newborn baby girl was dropped off at the same hospital and in need of immediate placement.</p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;I know I am crazy, but God is telling me to say &#8220;yes&#8221; kept coming out of my mouth over the next 10 minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hours later, Hannah was dropped off at the house of a friend and found a forever home with her and Grayson.</p>
<p>But when Katie took a closer look at Hannah&#8217;s tiny hospital bracelet, she made a truly stunning realization.</p>

<p>These are the children of Price, who is from Colorado.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Just a few years ago, she was newly divorced and searching for her purpose.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-179836" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13233030_10101424340212604_3255179327826391728_n.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="848" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13233030_10101424340212604_3255179327826391728_n.jpg 850w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13233030_10101424340212604_3255179327826391728_n-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13233030_10101424340212604_3255179327826391728_n-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13233030_10101424340212604_3255179327826391728_n-768x766.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13233030_10101424340212604_3255179327826391728_n-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>After her marriage ended, she decided to start over.</p>
<p>She made a career shift after purchasing a new home.</p>
<p>She received an email from her pastor. She&#8217;d had fertility issues in the past but always wanted to adopt, so he suggested she might be interested in fostering a child.</p>
<p>The person was interested but taking things slowly. She attended meetings about the foster care system and learned as much as she could about it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-179837" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/child-610449_960_720.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="555" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/child-610449_960_720.jpg 850w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/child-610449_960_720-300x196.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/child-610449_960_720-768x501.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>It was during a foster care meeting that she realized she wanted to be a foster parent. After fostering four children, she was ready to adopt a child of her own.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-179838" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Grayson-Page-Adoption-13.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Grayson-Page-Adoption-13.jpg 850w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Grayson-Page-Adoption-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Grayson-Page-Adoption-13-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>A four-day-old boy was dropped off at the hospital by a caseworker.</p>
<p>For the next year, social workers continued to try to locate the boy&#8217;s biological parents while he was being fostered.</p>
<p>No one claimed him.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-179839" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/img_6417-1.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/img_6417-1.jpg 850w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/img_6417-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/img_6417-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>She had fallen in love with him by this point.</p>
<p>His birth parents&#8217; rights were terminated by the court, allowing him to be legally adopted by Katie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2></h2>
<h2>Two weeks later, it took another turn.</h2>
<p>There was a dire situation that another caseworker called about. A newborn baby girl was dropped off at the same hospital and in need of immediate placement.</p>
<p>Even though she was terrified and overwhelmed, her gut told her to open her heart to the possibility of taking in this beautiful girl.</p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;I know I am crazy, but God is telling me to say yes&#8221; kept coming out of my mouth over the next 10 minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hours later, Hannah was dropped off at Katie&#8217;s place and found a home with her and Grayson.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-179841" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/424130402_887853d9cd_b.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="567" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/424130402_887853d9cd_b.jpg 850w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/424130402_887853d9cd_b-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/424130402_887853d9cd_b-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>The name on Hannah&#8217;s baby bracelet was the same as the name the birth mother gave to the hospital.</p>
<p>While looking over Hannah&#8217;s discharge papers, she realized the birth mom shared the same birth date as her son.</p>
<p>A strange coincidence, perhaps?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-179842" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5298664559_1c211c245d.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="580" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5298664559_1c211c245d.jpg 850w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5298664559_1c211c245d-300x205.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5298664559_1c211c245d-768x524.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>There was a suspicion that her two newly adopted children were related.</p>
<p>&#8220;Grayson is half African American with beautiful dark skin and dark hair. Baby Girl has pale white skin and straight red hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>She tracked down Hannah&#8217;s birth mother because she was determined to learn the truth. The second they met, she knew she was looking at the birth mom of her son.</p>
<p>The woman said she delivered a boy before delivering Hannah. The test confirmed that the two children are half-siblings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-179843" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed-3.jpg" alt="" width="850" height="565" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed-3.jpg 850w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed-3-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/unnamed-3-768x510.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;What if Baby Girl went to another family?&#8221; she asked in her post. &#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t have found her or her son&#8217;s mother. The connection would not have been made. I couldn&#8217;t believe it had just happened.&#8221;</p>

<h2>In December 2018, Katie had adopted Hannah.</h2>

<p>&#8220;I felt the strangest feeling when I said yes to the baby girl. I don&#8217;t think I had a true call from God until that moment.</p>
<p>My brain told me to say no because it was not in my plans, but something inside told me to say yes. It is a miracle. It is amazing that my children found each other.&#8221;</p>
