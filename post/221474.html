On this day, kids wait for Santa Claus to bring them gifts, but it looks like Santa came early this year and went straight to the home of Hollywood veteran Robert De Niro!

<p>For those who don&#8217;t know, Robert De <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/robert-de-niro-upset-with-president-trumps-behavior/">Niro</a> is known as one of the best actors of all time and often works with Martin Scorsese, who is known as one of the best directors. On Monday morning, a repeat thief broke into his Manhattan apartment and stole things from under the Christmas tree.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>A source said that the thief was a 30-year-old woman named Shanice Aviles, who is also known as &#8220;Known Burglar.&#8221; She got into Robert De Niro&#8217;s Upper East Side apartment by sneaking down a staircase. According to the reports, the police saw the woman go into the building&#8217;s basement at about 2:45 a.m., and there were signs that she had broken in. A New York Police Department spokesman said that the woman was trying to take things out of the living room. They also said they saw her take gifts from under the tree and put them in her bag. The accused person is known to the NYPD because she has been arrested many times for breaking and entering. They further added,</p>
<blockquote><p>the female was taken into custody without incident with charges pending. The investigation is ongoing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reports said that Robert De Niro was upstairs using his iPad when he heard the noise downstairs. At the time of the attempted break-in, his daughter was in her room in the apartment. When he came down, he was wearing his bathrobe, and luckily, no one was hurt.</p>
