			<p>After his ex-wife said that he was an abusive partner, Johnny Depp lost a number of movie roles. Pirates of the Caribbean&#8217;s Jack Sparrow was a big part that the actor had to give up. Depp played the role in all five of the movies in the series. He also said that a sixth movie in the series offered him $22 million. But Disney took back the offer after a report came out in which Amber Heard said she was a &#8220;public figure who represents domestic abuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that Depp won the defamation case against his ex-wife, there are rumors that the actor is ready for his comeback as Jack Sparrow. It is said that the Pirates of the Caribbean star is working on a new movie in the series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Johnny Depp is working on the next Pirates of the Caribbean movie in secret.</h2>
<p>It is said that Johnny Depp will be back as Jack Sparrow in the next Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Recent news stories say that the actor from Dark Shadows is secretly working on a new movie in the franchise.</p>
<p>A person who is close to both Disney and Johnny Depp has said that the details of the project are kept &#8220;top secret&#8221; because Depp is in it. A source even said that filming is set to begin in the UK at a secret location.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-217819" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Johnny-Depp-in-Mortdecai.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="562" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Johnny-Depp-in-Mortdecai.jpg 1000w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Johnny-Depp-in-Mortdecai-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Johnny-Depp-in-Mortdecai-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Johnny-Depp-in-Mortdecai-438x246.jpg 438w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Johnny-Depp-in-Mortdecai-255x144.jpg 255w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Johnny-Depp-in-Mortdecai-350x198.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Johnny is set to return as Captain Jack Sparrow and is scheduled to start filming at the beginning of February at a top-secret location in the UK,</p></blockquote>
<p>the source said.</p>
<p>The source said that everything is still in the early stages and that the project still doesn&#8217;t have a director. But the studio has everything planned out, and everyone who knows about the project has a call sheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Johnny Depp is supposed to do a test shoot at the beginning of February.</h2>
<p>The insider also said that Johnny Depp would do a test shoot at the beginning of February before the real filming would begin.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bruce Hendricks, who worked on the first three films, is named as the Executive Producer on the new project,</p></blockquote>
<p>the source further revealed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-217818" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/jack-aparrow.webp" alt="" width="1024" height="320" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/jack-aparrow.webp 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/jack-aparrow-300x94.webp 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/jack-aparrow-768x240.webp 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>The insider also said that nothing is known about the project yet and that Disney wants to keep it a secret for now. The sixth movie in the series might be called &#8220;A Day at the Sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rumors began when the name of an actor from &#8220;The Lone Ranger&#8221; was seen on a call sheet for a new Disney movie. Even though the star of &#8220;The Rum Diary&#8221; hasn&#8217;t said anything about it yet, some news stories have said that the rumors aren&#8217;t true. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>The Daily</strong></span> Mail also said that their sources told them that the information is not true.</p>

<p>Disney hasn&#8217;t said anything about a sixth Pirates of the Caribbean movie or about Depp coming back as Jack Sparrow. But his fans would love to see him on the big screen again, playing that role.</p>
<p>But the actor who played Edward Scissorhands has said he would never return to the series, even if Disney offered him &#8220;$300 million and a million alpacas.&#8221; Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales was the last time Depp played the role.</p>
<p>On Disney+, you can stream all of the movies of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.</p>
