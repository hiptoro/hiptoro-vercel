			<p>Sheldon, a labrador-retriever mix had been enrolled in a training program for becoming a good training dog. He was attending his training at Paws With A Cause in Wayland, Michigan, but unfortunately couldn&#8217;t make the required grades to clear his test.</p>
<p>Whenever he tried to catch a whiff, his concentration was interrupted. He just wanted to hunt the source at any cost.</p>
<p>His trainers decided that he was meant for a different canine career. So, instead of sending him to help civilians, he was promoted to the State Farm Arson Dog Program.</p>
<p>His excellent sniffing sense was put on work to locate illegal fires.</p>
<p>The dog and his partner, Lieutenant John Tadlock of the Saginaw, Texas fire department, go on different missions.</p>
<p>His very first mission was at a car dealership, where he inspected vechiles that were suspected to have some criminal substances.</p>

<p>“We get out of the truck and put him to work. It takes him about 30 seconds, and he gives me an alert,” Tadlock told the Hiptoro.</p>
<p>“We dig through some debris and find a Molotov cocktail. It was just under some debris from the vehicle that had burned away, three days earlier. You couldn’t even see it.” But Sheldon unearthed the evidence with ease.</p>
