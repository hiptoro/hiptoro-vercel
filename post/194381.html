			<p>Feminism in the United States has fought for women&#8217;s political, economic, and cultural freedom since the mid-19th century. One current TikTok trend shows that you can fight gender inequality on your own.</p>
<p>It started in January when user Molly Barrie uploaded a video, inviting people to share the &#8220;subtle feminist power moves&#8221; they do on the regular, and it wasn&#8217;t long before the clip spread all over the platform. We thought it would be interesting to check out some of the most popular submissions since International Women&#8217;s Day is around the corner.</p>

<p>I work in a male-dominated industry. It is not unusual for top executives to get very disrespectful or raise their voice in a meeting where they are not getting their way without fail. I hit them with the idea that they should take a five-minute break to get over their feelings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The majority of Americans think the country has not gone far enough to give women equal rights with men a century after the 19th Amendment was passed.</p>
<p>Among the individuals who think the nation actually has work to do in accomplishing orientation balance, 77% feature lewd behavior as a significant hindrance to ladies having equivalent privileges with men, 67% highlight ladies not having similar legitimate freedoms as men, 66% aren&#8217;t content with various cultural assumptions for people, and 64% say insufficient ladies are in important, influential places.</p>
<p>To look into the things these ladies are going through, we reached part-time task official/part-time blogger and full-time women&#8217;s activist from England, Nyomi Winter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I noticed sexism most once I had children,&#8221; the founder of the online magazine <a href="https://www.nomipalony.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nomipalony</a> told. &#8220;The expectation that you will be primary carer whilst you try to maintain a career is really challenging. We aren&#8217;t making nearly enough progress with the gender pay gap and in turn the pension pay gap. Workplace changes could make an enormous difference to equality.&#8221;</p>

<p>When a man interrupts a woman in a group social setting, I don&#8217;t look at him. I keep looking at the woman he interrupted. I interrupted him and asked the woman what he was saying. She always smiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the UK and the US, only a small percentage of young women would call themselves a feminist.</p>
<p>It could be that they don&#8217;t like the term because of the stereotypes associated with feminism. (&#8220;Feminists don&#8217;t wear makeup, they don&#8217;t shave their legs, and they hate all boys.&#8221;)</p>
<p>She believes that today&#8217;s feminists are more intersectional than ever and that she is happy with the direction the movement is going in. &#8220;I&#8217;m so impressed by today&#8217;s young feminists. We are more aware of &#8216;white feminism&#8217; and I think the Black Lives Matters movement has really pushed the Global Ethnic Majority to the front of the conversation in the past couple of years.&#8221;</p>

<p>So I am a tall lady. I&#8217;m around 5&#8217;10, 5&#8217;11ish, and assuming I will be going into a gathering where I realize that there will take care of business who will attempt to talk over me or disparage me or apply pressure where needed, I will intentionally wear the biggest heels, similar to the greatest heels that I have, which make me like 6&#8217;2, 6&#8217;3 so I can remain close to them and peer down on them and advise them that in addition to the fact that I am a counterpart for you mentally, yet I could step on you.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@emily_tangerine" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">TikTok user Emily Tangerine</a> is one of the people who responded to Molly with a video of her own. &#8220;I came across this trend on my &#8216;For You&#8217; page,&#8221; Emily told. &#8220;I follow a ton of women who are comedians and professionals in their respective fields and activists. So this prompt was surely going to come my way.&#8221;</p>
<p>She thinks that sexism in today&#8217;s society is complex. She thinks misogyny in today&#8217;s society is a really complex system. &#8220;I&#8217;d say the most oppressive force of it that is visible is the legislation that directly targets women (but will surely affect those who don’t identify as female but have a uterus) and somehow it doesn&#8217;t affect men,&#8221; Emily said. &#8220;Like the Texas abortion ban. There is currently no legislation against men&#8217;s bodies, yet we all know it takes two to tango.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emily sees women&#8217;s lives improving as the older generation of men fades into oblivion. &#8220;I see more and more women enrolling in college and that&#8217;s going to help the situation. And I see more and more women stand up for themselves in social situations. &#8220;I stood up to my old male professor just this Friday. Women aren&#8217;t allowing men to treat them like dog shit anymore and that eventually leads to legislation. Heck, we might even get one more woman on the Supreme Court.&#8221;</p>

<p>I regularly guarantee that men don&#8217;t have arms. Listen to me. So I was having a discussion with a colleague as of late and she was discussing the way in which she needed her child to wed a lady who could cook. Furthermore, I said &#8216;why?&#8217; And she said &#8216;Well, he can&#8217;t cook&#8217; And I said &#8216;Good gracious, does he not have arms?&#8217; And then, at that point, she was like &#8216;no, he&#8217;s simply a man&#8217; And I was like &#8216;However he has arms&#8217; And then, at that point, she just needed to clarify that he planned to rely upon a lady to take care of him for the remainder of his reality with like, two entire arms. No doubt men don&#8217;t have arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes [the situation] feels really bleak (like with the recent tragic murders of Sarah Everard, Bibaa Henry, Nicole Smallman, and Sabina Nessa),&#8221; Nyomi added. &#8220;But I do think that social media has opened up conversations that we just weren&#8217;t having in the mainstream a decade ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Me Too Movement has led to real industry changes (including arrests). The movement following Sarah Evarard&#8217;s murder led to an outpouring from women on social media the likes of which I&#8217;ve never seen. I wrote <a href="https://www.nomipalony.com/20-actions-men-can-take-to-be-better-allies-to-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20 actions men can take to be better allies to women at this time</a> and it was one of my most-read posts that year. Yes, change is too slow but we have to have hope that it&#8217;s coming and in the meantime, we keep fighting!&#8221;</p>
<p>They&#8217;re not the only optimists. More than eight-in-ten Americans say that the country has not gone far enough to give women equal rights with men in the future. Let&#8217;s hope so!</p>
