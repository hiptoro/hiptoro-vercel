<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s possible to say that sins of the flesh aren&#8217;t the worst among the sins.</h2>

<p>He says people who adopt pets instead of children are selfish, and it is a topic he has always shared with the world.</p>
<p>Continue scrolling to find out why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Pope is a very important figure.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185241" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-365.png" alt="" width="762" height="538" /></p>
<p>The Pope figure&#8217;s <a class="new-window" href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/feb/13/popes-full-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earliest record</a> goes way back to the 11th century.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He&#8217;s just not the leader of the Roman Catholic Church but also the Bishop of Rome.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185242" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-366.png" alt="" width="762" height="563" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pretty big deal being elected as the Pope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Since 2013, he&#8217;s been the head of Vatican City state and the Catholic church.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185254" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-367.png" alt="" width="762" height="509" /></p>
<p>He&#8217;s a member of the Society of Jesus. Also, he&#8217;s the first-ever Jesuit Pope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>His love for Catholicism didn&#8217;t really start there.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185255" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-368.png" alt="" width="762" height="508" /></p>
<p>In 1969 he became a Catholic Priest and in 1998 he became an archbishop. He was made a cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II, but he wasn&#8217;t elected as the Pope until the following year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>For many people, he&#8217;s a huge figurehead all over the world.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185256" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-369.png" alt="" width="762" height="509" /></p>
<p>Pope Francis has been celebrated for his humility, emphasis on God&#8217;s mercy, international visibility as pope, concern for the poor, and commitment to interfaith dialogue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He evens lights up his followers&#8217; hearts.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185271" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-370.png" alt="" width="762" height="510" /></p>
<p>Many of his followers are able to talk to him and receive advice from him because he is interacting with the public and members of the church.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Pope&#8217;s a big deal for sure.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185272" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-371.png" alt="" width="762" height="508" /></p>
<p>However, not everyone is impressed with his opinions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185285" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-372.png" alt="" width="754" height="349" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185286" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-373.png" alt="" width="755" height="443" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185287" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-374.png" alt="" width="757" height="397" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185288" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-375.png" alt="" width="756" height="155" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>There&#8217;s a reason behind the disdain.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185289" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-376.png" alt="" width="762" height="431" /></p>
<p>Pope Francis changed the law of the Roman Catholic Church to allow women to serve as an altar servers, distributors of communion, and readers at liturgies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It seemed as if their angel was looking out for women of the church.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185290" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-377.png" alt="" width="762" height="508" /></p>
<p>The change in the Code of Canon Law will allow women to be in those roles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Francis wrote that he wanted to bring stability and public recognition to women already serving in the roles.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185291" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-378.png" alt="" width="762" height="513" /></p>
<p>“This shift brings the institutional Church in alignment with the pastoral realities around the world,” said Kate McElwee, executive director of the Women’s Ordination Conference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Women are not being given the equality they are deserving of.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185292" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-379.png" alt="" width="608" height="910" /></p>
<p>The main issue is that women are still blocked from other roles within the church, while this new law formalizes what is already going on in a lot of countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Pope made a series of statements that got people talking on social media.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185342" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-380.png" alt="" width="762" height="507" /></p>
<p>People thought that the statements coming from him were rich.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In the past few decades, there have been instances of child sexual abuse in the Catholic church.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185343" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-381.png" alt="" width="762" height="508" /></p>
<p>Pope Francis&#8217; latest announcement has really riled people up. The inquiry found that 216,000 children in France had been abused by the clergy.</p>
<p>We are pretty sure that it is a lot higher than Pope Francis thinks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="h-sins-of-the-flesh-are-not-the-most-serious-pope-francis-said-to-reporters-when-he-was-on-the-way-back-from-greece-to-italy-as-per-independent">“Sins of the flesh are not the most serious,” Pope Francis said to reporters when he was on the way back from Greece to Italy, as per <a class="new-window" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/pope-francis-pre-marital-sex-b1971894.html?r=88328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Independent</a>.</h3>

<p>According to Pope Francis, pride and hatred are the most serious sins.</p>
<p>Some people think that sex outside of marriage is a high-up sin.</p>
<p>Some people took to social media to name a couple of sins that are more serious than pride, hatred, and sex outside of marriage. And guess what? The Church has been committing these sins for a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pope Francis once again made a statement, saying that certain choices people make are selfish.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185345" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-383.png" alt="" width="762" height="514" /></p>
<p>People really got riled up.</p>

<h2>The Pope told people at the Vatican yesterday that it was time to criticize the lives of people around the world.</h2>

<p>According to him, people not having children are basically robbing humanity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>And people who have pets instead of children, are selfish.</h2>

<p>“We see that people do not want to have children, or just one and no more. And many, many couples do not have children because they do not want to, or they have just one – but they have two dogs, two cats… Yes, dogs and cats take the place of children,” he began, as per <a class="new-window" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/pope-calls-out-selfish-couples-who-have-pets-instead-of-children-20220105?source=facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR3GRoJYoqxitICvBTcAiP-s2XqKjCjZXviUF66ckVFMBDsk8BtlLDkap5o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LADbible.</a></p>

<p>“And in this way, civilization becomes aged and without humanity, because it loses the richness of fatherhood and motherhood. And our homeland suffers, as it does not have children,” he <a class="new-window" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/pope-calls-out-selfish-couples-who-have-pets-instead-of-children-20220105?source=facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR3GRoJYoqxitICvBTcAiP-s2XqKjCjZXviUF66ckVFMBDsk8BtlLDkap5o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continued</a>.</p>

<p>“Having a child is always a risk, either naturally or by adoption. But it is riskier not to have them. It is riskier to deny fatherhood, or to deny motherhood, be it real or spiritual,” he <a class="new-window" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/pope-calls-out-selfish-couples-who-have-pets-instead-of-children-20220105?source=facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR3GRoJYoqxitICvBTcAiP-s2XqKjCjZXviUF66ckVFMBDsk8BtlLDkap5o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed</a>.</p>
