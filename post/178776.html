			Waitress Gets '$0' Tip On '$187' Bill, Turns Heads After Making Facebook Post In Response

			<p>One of the waitresses of Colorado has used social media to tell about working in America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the bill of $187.43, Taylor Cordova received a $0 tip. After that, she has taken the bill&#8217;s picture and posted it on Facebook.</p>

<p>“You are the lowest of the low,” she wrote, speaking not just to the customer who stiffed her, but also to anyone who does not tip. Then she continued with an explanation of the consequences of diners not adding proper gratuity to their bill:</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever you feel like it&#8217;s probably fine to not tip your server, that&#8217;s one more bill stacking up because they&#8217;re short on money. This is food for the week that our families will go without because you didn&#8217;t think it was necessary, even after asking for everything under the sun and receiving it free of charge, mind you. This is one less basic necessity my daughter needs because even TWO more dollars is too much for you. Every decision has a consequence. Servers are paid a base pay of $2-5/hr depending on the employer, so next time you don&#8217;t want to tip, regardless of the situation prior to receiving your bill, think about how much you would have to work that week off $2-5/hr to feed your family, not just you. Could you pay your bills based on that pay alone? Could you feed your family AND yourself? Because that&#8217;s what happens when you choose to not tip.&#8221;</p>
<p>She used the facts of labor departments that explain “An employer of a tipped employee is only required to pay $2.13 per hour in direct wages if that amount combined with the tips received at least equals the federal minimum wage.”</p>

<p>Cordova’s post comes to an end with a piece of guidance. “Don&#8217;t even bother walking into a restaurant if you can&#8217;t afford to tip,” she wrote. “There&#8217;s a McDonald&#8217;s down the street if you&#8217;re that cheap.”</p>
