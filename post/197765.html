			<p>A million dollars wasn&#8217;t enough to convince Edith Macefield to sell her family home.</p>
<p>Money doesn&#8217;t mean much when you&#8217;re older.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It doesn&#8217;t mean much if you have lots of things.</h2>
<p>Family, friends, and a happy home are what matter the most.</p>

<p>Edith Macefield said no when developers offered her a million dollars to move so they could build more places that sell stuff and offer stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Macefield wanted to stay in her old home.</h2>
<p>Some people called the move punk rock or a middle finger in the face of capitalism and its pursuit of growth in order to increase profits.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-197770" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-507.png" alt="" width="538" height="868" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-507.png 538w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-507-186x300.png 186w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /></p>
<p>It is not known if Macefield saw it that way, but she did live her life the way she saw fit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The army brought her to England after she told her mother she was going to college at the age of 16.</h2>
<p>She was kicked out of the army after they realized she was under the age of 18 and toured with the Royal Army&#8217;s marching band and took in war orphans after staying in England.</p>

<p>She convinced some of her friends that she was a spy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Macefield moved to Seattle in 1952.</h2>
<p>Macefield and the developers were in a stalemate after she refused to sell her home.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-197771" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-508.png" alt="" width="538" height="843" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-508.png 538w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-508-191x300.png 191w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /></p>
<p>The developers built a huge office and retail complex around her house. All of 46th street was purchased except for Macefield&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The big grey-blocked buildings are a far cry from the rural neighborhood that used to be by the lake.</h2>
<p>The story for the movie &#8220;Up&#8221; wasn&#8217;t directly inspired by the Macefield house, but Disney Pixar did attach balloons to the house to promote the movie. Macefield&#8217;s home became a local symbol for anti-development and the Fiercely Independent spirit.</p>

<p>The Macefield Music Festival was named after her in honor of holding onto things that are important to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>After Macefield died, she left the home to Barry Martin.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-197772" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-510.png" alt="" width="538" height="808" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-510.png 538w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-510-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px" /></p>
<p>Several attempts were made by the community to save the home and keep it as a landmark after it was scheduled to be demolished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Many people are tying balloons to the fence.</h2>
<p>“There are always people rolling by here. They’re very emotionally attached to it,” Steven Raymond told <a href="https://www.q13fox.com/news/real-life-up-house-in-seattle-will-be-saved-developer-says">Fox 13 Seattle</a>. “I think it speaks volumes about how fast the city is changing and how people love to hold on to a little bit of magic.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-197773" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-511.png" alt="" width="539" height="822" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-511.png 539w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-511-197x300.png 197w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /></p>
<p>The attempts to raise money to save the house failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The developers decided to keep the house as part of their development a decade after Macefield&#8217;s death.</h2>
<p>It seems that the home and development are in a good relationship.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-197774" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-512.png" alt="" width="430" height="900" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-512.png 430w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screenshot-512-143x300.png 143w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></p>
<p>“Honestly, I think we’re a lot alike,” a developer once said about Macefield. ” I’m stubborn and so was she. We’ve had some incredible arguments. She was amazingly smart. I think this illustrate’s Edith’s character.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The house serves as a draw to the area where people can shop and a good place to take selfies, while also bringing joy and wonder to the community.</h2>
<p>The Macefield house is a testament to freedom, standing your ground, and the magic that still exists when the community decides it does. All you have to do is say no.</p>
