			<p>When you travel from home to office or back to home, it is the best time to take out a book and educate yourself about any topic that you have an interest in.</p>
<p>Often, people catch a sight of commuter reading books based on weird topics. People couldn&#8217;t resist themselves from snapping an image and sending it across to Subway Creatures Instagram page. The community on If has 21 million followers. It is dedicated to sharing weird things that people see on public transit</p>

<p>Rick McGuire, the founder of &#8216;Subway Creatures,&#8217; told Hiptoro that the most interesting people are found in the subways. Poeple have no choice but to deal with each other in confined spaces.</p>

<p>McGuire said that he started the &#8216;Subway Creatures&#8217; website in 2011 and then moved on to Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook a short while afterward. &#8220;I was commuting to work in NYC everyday and seeing the wild, bizarre, and crazy things the city has to offer and noticed there really wasn&#8217;t a place where it was all being documented.&#8221; That&#8217;s why &#8216;Subway Creatures&#8217; came into existence.</p>
<p>&#8220;NYC has this unspoken rule of &#8216;keep your head down and mind your own business&#8217; but I&#8217;m a huge people-watcher. There&#8217;s so much going on around you at all times and it would be a shame to miss some of these typical &#8216;New York moments.&#8217; When I&#8217;m on the train I always find myself looking for obscurities and checking my surroundings. You never know what you&#8217;ll see!&#8221; McGuire shared his love of people-watching on the subway.</p>

<p>Career coach Friedman told Bored Panda that a lot can be said in favor of not always being productive. &#8220;A commute is literally a transitional unit of space and time, and a lot of commuters use it as their break between the responsibilities of home and the responsibilities of work or school, so it&#8217;s the perfect moment to look at pictures of failed cakes or animals making funny faces. It&#8217;s just nice to have time where nobody is holding you accountable,&#8221; Friedman told us that it&#8217;s alright to cut ourselves a little bit of slack sometimes.</p>
<p>Friedman said that it can be very therapeutic to &#8220;disassociate and zone out&#8221; during our commute. Especially when we&#8217;re feeling stressed out. &#8220;That might be scrolling through social media or half-listening to a podcast. I&#8217;ll also say some of my best ideas have come to me when I&#8217;ve been staring out a window or at a wall,&#8221; the career coach said. &#8220;If work is really taxing, you might find that bringing something on your ride lets you focus away from the distractions of the office—it actually might be a lot easier to knock out a report without a chatty coworker hovering nearby.&#8221;</p>
<h2>9.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-110572 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9-32.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="875" /></h2>
<p>According to Friedman, it is a great time to learn something new, such as improving your communications skill, arranging your weekly calendar and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might also find yourself more productive at work if you spend your commute doing something like reading or playing a strategy game that gets your brain warmed up. If you are actively walking / driving / biking, taking a different route can help shake things up and break up the monotony,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless you have a very long commute, it&#8217;s probably pushing it to try to get into any kind of study or meaningful work that requires a state of flow, but it could be a good time to watch a 5-minute refresher tutorial on a new skill you&#8217;re working on or to skim through an article your colleagues will also have read.&#8221;</p>
