			<p>This is the amazing moment when a lost Border Collie walked into a police station and turned itself in. It had gotten separated from its owner and was looking for him.</p>
<p>Police called Rosie &#8220;smart&#8221; after she got lost recently and walked through the automatic doors into the waiting room of the station in Loughborough, Leicestershire.</p>
<p>Her owner had been looking for her like crazy but couldn&#8217;t find her.</p>
<p>But an hour later, Rosie&#8217;s owner was happy to see her again.</p>
<p>Leicestershire Police said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thankfully she was wearing a collar, so a lead was available to contact Rosie&#8217;s owner, who was delighted she had been found safe and well.</p>
<p>Rosie was being walked nearby with a second dog when she managed to wander off. What a lovely, clever dog.</p>
<p>Our staff fetched some water for Rosie, and made fast friends with plenty of fuss.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the police put the video on their Facebook page, more than 2,000 people have watched and shared it.</p>

<p>Glad she ended up safe and well at the police station.</p></blockquote>
<p>Karon Kendillon-Hollis said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I didn&#8217;t even know humans could get into Loughborough police station still.</p></blockquote>
