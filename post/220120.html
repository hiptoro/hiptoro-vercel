			<p>A few days after Ronnie Turner died, more information has come out about what caused his death.</p>
<p>The office of the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner says that Ronnie Turner, the youngest son of singer Tina Turner and the late Ike Turner, died because of complications from metastatic colon cancer.</p>
<p>Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was also on the list of important conditions, and his death was confirmed to be natural.</p>
<p>Ronnie&#8217;s wife, Afida Turner, told the world on December 9 that her husband had died at the age of 62. In her heartfelt tribute, she said that Ronnie was &#8220;a real angel.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>I did the best to the end this time I was no[t] able to save you,</p></blockquote>
<p>she wrote alongside a series of photos.</p>
<blockquote><p>Love you for&#8230; 17 years this is very very very bad and I am very mad. This is a tragedy u with your brother Craig and your father Ike Turner and Aline rest in paradiseâ€¦ So unfair.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2018, Tina&#8217;s oldest son Craig, whose father was the late saxophonist Raymond Hill, killed himself. This was another sad loss for the Turner family.</p>
<p>In a Dec. 11 statement to s source, Shawn Zanotti, Ronnie&#8217;s agent, also confirmed that he had died.</p>
<p>Even though his parents were well-known musicians, Ronnie tried his hand at acting. He was in the 1993 movie What&#8217;s Love Got to Do With It.</p>

<p>Shortly after Ronnie&#8217;s wife posted her tribute, Tina also wrote an Instagram post about her son&#8217;s life and what he meant to her.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Ronnie, you left the world far too early,</p></blockquote>
<p>the singer wrote.</p>
<blockquote><p>In sorrow I close my eyes and think of you, my beloved son.</p></blockquote>
