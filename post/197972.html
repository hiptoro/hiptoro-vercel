			<h2>The reason why animals never bore is that they are full of surprises.</h2>
<p>Pets aren’t just about sweet purrs, going for walks, or begging for treats. They are also about sudden cuddles, high fives, unusual sleeping positions, and so on. Even experienced pet owners confess that their 4-legged friends can suddenly surprise them. Fortunately, we always have a chance to grab a camera and take some pictures.</p>
<p>There is no way a person can get bored while they are around animals. Today we are going to enjoy some examples of this miraculous power that animals possess.</p>
