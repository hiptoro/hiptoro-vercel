			<p>When he was traveling to France for the D-Day celebration of World War II veterans, an American veteran who had served in the war and was 97 years old at the time met a French woman who was 92 years old and with whom he had fallen in love during the war. After 75 years, they were able to recognize each other and find each other again; this demonstrates that genuine love does in fact exist.</p>

<p>During the course of the war, an American soldier found himself falling in love with a French girl of 18 years of age who was a resident of the town where the soldiers were stationed. KT Robbins was a young soldier in the United States Army at the time; he was only 24 years old. As soon as he laid eyes on the French girl Jeannine Ganaye, who was only 18 at the time, he was completely taken with her. In the year 1944, this took place in the town of Briey.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>The circumstance that led to their first encounter was that Robbins needed to have his clothes laundered. The boy&#8217;s clothes will be washed by Jeannine&#8217;s mother, who has agreed to do so. The moment the two individuals laid eyes on one another, they knew it was love at first sight. Robbins, however, was forced to leave for the Eastern Front two months later in order to fight against the Axis powers. He let her know that he might return and take her with him this time. Jeannine was extremely distraught over the fact that he would eventually move to the United States without her.</p>

<p>She decided to educate herself in English because she had so much faith that he would return for her. Instead, Robbins, who was a member of the 26th Infantry and the First Division, served with the bakery battalion later on and came back to the United States by himself.</p>
<p>There, he met the woman who would become his wife, Lillian, and who would remain by his side for the next seven decades until her passing in 2015. Over the next half-century, the two spent their time at work side by side in a Mississippi hardware store. As for Jeannine, she also tied the knot in 1949, but this time with a different person. She ultimately gave birth to five children.</p>

<p>Robbins never stopped thinking about the French girl with whom he fell hopelessly in love. For the next seven decades, he would keep her photograph. He showed the photograph to the French journalists who were conducting the interview with him. During the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of D-Day, he was looking for her and her family in the event that she was still alive. It wasn&#8217;t entirely clear to him whether or not she was still alive.</p>
<p>Jeannine was located by journalists in a retirement community that was only 43 kilometers (27 miles) away from her hometown, which is where the two of them first met. It had been 75 years since the two had seen each other, so their first encounter after being apart was an emotional one as they gazed into each other&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>Robbins assured her that he had never stopped loving her and that he had never been able to forget her in his heart. When she questioned him about his absence, he explained that he had gotten married and was unable to return because of his new commitment. Robbins was only able to spend a couple of hours with everyone before he had to leave to attend another celebration in Normandy. Despite this, the two committed to resuming their relationship in the future. Following an absence of seventy-five years, the reunion culminated in a passionate first kiss.</p>
