			<p>If you want to feel good, go to Jennifer Garner&#8217;s Instagram page every day. The actress publishes images from the set. rides a lawnmower or performs a dance routine for the camera. She also mocks her friends and herself.</p>
<p>We spent some time at Hiptoro looking at Jennifer&#8217;s Instagram and browsing the site. Then we came to the conclusion that we had to inform you of what we had learned about our favorite actress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Jennifer continues to keep her teddy.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212010" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0b303d50e48a5310ac4b44bc66.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="500" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0b303d50e48a5310ac4b44bc66.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0b303d50e48a5310ac4b44bc66-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>The actress still has her preferred childhood stuffed animal. She once shared a picture of 5-year-old Jen holding a teddy bear on her page, and she posted a freshly taken picture next to it that was similar. “45 years later, you’re still my main squeeze, Teddy Bear,” Garner wrote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>She initially desired to become a teacher before switching to chemical engineering.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212009" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cd08e6528eac039b3738c88821.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="650" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cd08e6528eac039b3738c88821.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cd08e6528eac039b3738c88821-300x268.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>As a young girl, Jennifer wanted to be a teacher like her mother Pat, who was a college English instructor. After graduating from high school, the future actress made the decision to attend Denison University in Granville, where her chemical engineer father had studied. She soon switched from chemistry to theater, though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>After their divorce, the actress and Ben Affleck were still close.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212008" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/5cb79854578ed7bfb76545dead.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="508" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/5cb79854578ed7bfb76545dead.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/5cb79854578ed7bfb76545dead-300x209.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>She was also among the first to congratulate Jennifer Lopez and Ben Lopez on their marriage. Garner wished them happiness and sent them a lovely bouquet of flowers. For their three children, who need a father figure in their lives, the actress thinks it&#8217;s crucial to maintain a cordial relationship with her ex.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Jennifer is a skilled saxophonist.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212007" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/b397b855858e8d0ea819728653.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="830" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/b397b855858e8d0ea819728653.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/b397b855858e8d0ea819728653-263x300.jpg 263w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>She once participated in the marching band in high school. Her sax, however, hasn&#8217;t been gathering dust in a closet. Once, Jennifer made the decision to come up with a unique way to wish her friend Reese Witherspoon a happy birthday. She listened to this song while posting on Instagram, “Many moons ago, my high school marching band played this song for homecoming. Today I play it for my boo. We have a groovy kind of love. Happy birthday, Lady.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The actress is very close to both of her sisters.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212006" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/321e8b5cd08d1798f82b57f8f9.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="1029" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/321e8b5cd08d1798f82b57f8f9.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/321e8b5cd08d1798f82b57f8f9-212x300.jpg 212w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/321e8b5cd08d1798f82b57f8f9-724x1024.jpg 724w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Susannah and Melissa are her sisters. The girls were brought up by their strict parents. When they were teenagers, Jennifer and her sisters were forbidden from donning makeup, getting their ears pierced, or getting their hair dyed. The actress also remembers, grinning, “As a little kid, I was tortured by my sisters’ birthdays, as their celebrations were within 2 weeks of each other and right after Christmas. Poor me! No one pays any attention!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>She holds a Doctor of Humane Letters honoris causa degree.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212005" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ef51f45633b28dffa0fdfcbc8f.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="669" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ef51f45633b28dffa0fdfcbc8f.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ef51f45633b28dffa0fdfcbc8f-300x276.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>At the commencement ceremony at the college she attended and graduated from in 1994, she received this degree. “When your dear friend becomes a beloved professor at your alma mater and hoods you with an honorary doctorate of humane letters, it is a very good day,” she <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxnfBNIDEzr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">wrote</a> on her Instagram.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Some of the stunts are done by the actress herself.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212004" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/8127a4537d88d5468b71ea8c5d.png" alt="" width="728" height="736" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/8127a4537d88d5468b71ea8c5d.png 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/8127a4537d88d5468b71ea8c5d-297x300.png 297w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/8127a4537d88d5468b71ea8c5d-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Jennifer shared a video from the set of the comedy Yes Day in 2021 in which she was hoisted into the air by ropes and performed a mock parachute jump. Garner performed 98% of her own stunts for the action thriller Peppermint, according to Shauna Duggins, her stunt double.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>However, Jennifer is not a big fan of rides on roller coasters.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212003" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/17938e5a54a5bc1698e049e78c.png" alt="" width="728" height="602" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/17938e5a54a5bc1698e049e78c.png 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/17938e5a54a5bc1698e049e78c-300x248.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>She had to ride a roller coaster during the filming of Yes Day. Jennifer claimed that she didn&#8217;t really enjoy it. “Shooting at Six Flags Magic Mountain is a dream come true. Unless you hate roller coasters,” she wrote on her Instagram.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>For a very long time, she had been afraid to get her ears pierced.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212002" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/a282a95f179766d2503e36ba6b.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="561" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/a282a95f179766d2503e36ba6b.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/a282a95f179766d2503e36ba6b-300x231.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>The actress has only recently started wearing ear clips. She had her ears pierced in 2006 so she could wear a stunning pair of chandelier earrings during the Academy Awards, but her holes eventually closed up. Only at the age of 48 did she decide to get her ears pierced once more, and she was unsure if her father would approve. He eventually had a discussion with Jennifer, and he agreed with her choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>She gets her energy from the environment.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212001" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/393bef5b478dda63d2a1512a67.png" alt="" width="728" height="756" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/393bef5b478dda63d2a1512a67.png 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/393bef5b478dda63d2a1512a67-289x300.png 289w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Jennifer now spends a lot of time in the country after purchasing the farm where her mother was raised. She occasionally shares pictures of farm animals and makes the claim that morning meditation is the best way to fill the rest of the day with energy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>On her Instagram, Jennifer posts some of her favorite recipes.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212000" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/46c6f0588a9d23b37cf93e99e5.png" alt="" width="728" height="1071" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/46c6f0588a9d23b37cf93e99e5.png 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/46c6f0588a9d23b37cf93e99e5-204x300.png 204w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/46c6f0588a9d23b37cf93e99e5-696x1024.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Her recipes have been tagged with the hashtag #PretendCookingShow. She recently shared a meatball recipe that was modified for kids. A recipe for cinnamon toast was once shared by her, and she wrote, “This perfect updated cinnamon toast makes for an indulgent Sunday morning or after school snack — and will give you instant Mom Hero Status.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The actress is not intimidated by awkward circumstances.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211999" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0ede5659e382c3571bff4f064d.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="538" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0ede5659e382c3571bff4f064d.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0ede5659e382c3571bff4f064d-300x222.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Jennifer once uploaded a video to Instagram demonstrating how she accidentally spilled coffee on her white pants. “Back to school hectic craziness and spilling coffee on the back of your pants. Staring at the walls over here. Happy Friday!” she wrote.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>One of the co-founders of a business that makes organic, fresh baby food is Jennifer.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211998" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/4dc3945a97ad9b7dc750cf8c21.png" alt="" width="728" height="769" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/4dc3945a97ad9b7dc750cf8c21.png 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/4dc3945a97ad9b7dc750cf8c21-284x300.png 284w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Once Upon a Farm is the name of the business where the actress serves as the chief brand officer. 2018 saw its founding, and Jennifer works hard to spread the word about it. She frequently updates us on news from company events and stresses the value of maintaining a healthy diet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In the past, she embellished a tree in support of the LGBTQ movement.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211997" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bcdd5c5efb9a36d1a12f6e5c73.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="500" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bcdd5c5efb9a36d1a12f6e5c73.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/bcdd5c5efb9a36d1a12f6e5c73-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>In 2022, Jennifer made the decision to show her support for the LGBTQ movement by draping a tree in her garden with a rainbow of ribbons. She then posted a video with the hashtag #HappyPride on her Instagram. It should be noted that the actress has done it previously. She supported Pride Month in 2020 by adorning a tree with bows, trinkets, and birdhouses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Jennifer Garner supports the early education of kids from low-income families.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211996" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/42118f55db914d838f57d4ee40.png" alt="" width="728" height="875" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/42118f55db914d838f57d4ee40.png 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/42118f55db914d838f57d4ee40-250x300.png 250w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>The actress is a member of the board of directors for Save the Children USA. She supports national initiatives in nutrition, early childhood education, and literacy. Jennifer frequently pays a visit to families enrolled in the Early Steps to School Success program. She also supports the notion of a healthy diet for kids. “We want all children to have access to organic, high-quality nutrition. We may be small but our hearts are mighty.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>She has no problem showing her face unadorned.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211995" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/77cf4c5d63bed6fd4934a52026.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="728" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/77cf4c5d63bed6fd4934a52026.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/77cf4c5d63bed6fd4934a52026-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/77cf4c5d63bed6fd4934a52026-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/77cf4c5d63bed6fd4934a52026-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>More than 500,000 people liked the picture of the actress wearing only a bathrobe and house shoes because she had to hurry to get her daughter to the school bus. “She barely made the bus on time, but at least her mother kept it classy,” Jennifer wrote.</p>
