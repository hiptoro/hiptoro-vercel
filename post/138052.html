			Conspiracy Theorist ‘Proves’ The Earth Is Flat With A Spirit Level On A Plane, And The ‘Evidence’ Is Making People Cringe

			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a thing with conspiracy theories. It is that some theories never die no matter how much evidence has been given or </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">how much time goes by. In the list of such conspiracy theories, the most popular one is the Flat Earth Theory. There are people who have been saying that the earth is flat while some say that the earth is a spinning sphere. If you are also interested in getting an answer to this thing, stay tuned! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A guy named Darryle Marble believes that the earth is flat. “He took a spirit level on a plane to see if the bubble moved. In his YouTube video, he argues that because the bubble didn’t move, the planet isn’t curved. He even did the math.” That’s crazy, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I recorded a 23 minute and 45 seconds time-lapse, which by those measurements means the plane traveled a little over 203 miles. According to curvature math given to explain the globe model, this should have resulted in the compensation of 5 miles of curvature. As you’ll see there was no measurable compensation for curvature,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">McIntyre said: “They are to be commended for actually trying to test their hypothesis, but of course they don’t understand at all how science actually works. Specifically, they are ignorant of gravitational pull. One of their main arguments was that if the Earth was spinning the water would fall off. Do they not understand that gravitational pull comes from the center, is based on mass, and works on water too?”</span></p>
<h2>Flat-Earther Marble brought a spirit level on a plane and shared his ‘proof’ that the Earth isn’t curved in a video</h2>
<p>“I used that question in person at FEIC [Flat Earth International Conference] 2018 and it was very telling. Most of them just said ‘proof’ and I said ‘proof of what?’ They couldn’t be specific. This shows that their beliefs weren’t really based on evidence in the first place,” he explained.</p>
<p>“For one thing, where is the cash? Even the main speakers, or organizers of the conference, didn’t seem like they were rich. We’re not talking about ExxonMobil creating disinformation about climate change so they can continue to sell oil. After about an hour face to face with these folks, I determined that virtually all of them believe it. Some are stronger in that belief than others, but I didn’t catch one person who seemed like they were just trolling,” McIntyre shared his experience with us.</p>
<p>“Maybe I’m being naive? Surely some trolls are out there. But at one session I heard many Flat Earthers talk about losing family members, getting kicked out of their churches, losing jobs… who would do that for fun? These are hardcore science deniers. As hard as it might be to accept, there are people who believe this stuff and are willing even to put their lives on the line for it! One rocket guy crashed trying to prove Flat Earth. They aren’t pretending.”</p>
<p>“Conspiracy theories have been around since Nero in the Roman Empire. They pop up in times of turmoil or mass unrest when people try to make sense of the world, but can’t. Flat Earth is in some ways just a run of the mill conspiracy theory. They’ve all grown in popularity because beliefs (even fringe beliefs) are reinforced by peer approval, and that is now readily available on the internet. Virtually all of the flat earthers I met were converted based on Youtube videos. Some then went to the conferences. After that, they were ‘down the rabbit hole.&#8217;”</p>
<p>“It’s important to remember that these pathologies of human reasoning exist not just to defend themselves but to proselytize new members. They are virulent. They are infectious. I wish Flat Earth were the worst of them, but it isn’t. It’s the scourge of our age. And it will only continue to get worse.”</p>
<h2>Marble believes that he found undeniable evidence that the Earth is supposedly flat</h2>

<p>“It seemed clear that, when his feet were held to the fire, that he backed off of actually endorsing Flat Earth beliefs and was instead using it as a way of articulating a kind of generalized mistrust in conventional dogma that’s become very common these days.”</p>
<p>The Professor continued: “The same has been shown in recent surveys of QAnon believers—few actually believe the more fringe elements, whereas many do endorse sympathy with the spirit of it. I sometimes liken this to distinguishing between Bible literalists and ‘true believers’ and those that embrace the Bible in a more metaphorical way. Unfortunately, surveys that query different degrees of belief conviction often fail to capture the details of individual belief, giving us a false impression of just how many believers are out there.”</p>
