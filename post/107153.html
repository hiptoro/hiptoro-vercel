			<p>I have a dog at home. I still do remember the first time I saw this little baby with brown nose and bright glittery eyes. Seeing her for the first time, I knew that she was the one for me. I immediately brought her home and the first time she licked me is still fresh in my memories. The overexcited and emotional feeling of seeing your dog for the first time is out of this world.</p>
<p>We at Hiptoro have compiled a list of the first reaction of owners seeing their pooches. They know that in good and bad, highs and low, these little furry buddies will stick around till the end.</p>
