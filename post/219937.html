			<p>Gwen Renée Stefani is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and fashion designer who is better known as Gwen Stefani. She also helped start the rock band No Doubt and is the lead singer for that group.</p>
<p>Just a Girl, Don&#8217;t Speak, Rick Girl, It&#8217;s My Life, The Sweet Escape, Luxurious, Hey Baby, and Spiderwebs are some of her best-known songs.</p>
<p>Stefani was born in October 1969, and she just turned 53 a few weeks ago. Fans find it hard to believe that the singer is over fifty years old because she looks so young.</p>
<p>The Hollaback Girl turned 53 on October 3, and many of her fans took to social media to say how shocked and interested they were in her age.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gwen Stefani is either ageless or freeze-dried,</p></blockquote>

<p>According to a source, the singer and one of the main songwriters for No Doubt told James Corden in 2016 her secret for staying young forever while they were doing carpool karaoke.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m writing music about happiness and truth….so that’s what the facelift is,</p></blockquote>
<p>she told the comedian in an episode of <a href="https://youtu.be/F2SXmzk8ve4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Late Late Show</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m writing music about happiness and truth.</p></blockquote>
<p>In an interview with Forbes earlier this year, the Luxurious singer talked about her favorite beauty rules and how she would tell her younger self to take care of her skin.</p>
<blockquote><p>Skin care is a moving target as you age. Your skin is always changing and evolving. And there are constantly new and improved products being released to try. I’ve always kept my skincare pretty simple and minimal though,</p></blockquote>
<p>she told the publication.</p>
<blockquote><p>My morning routine usually includes a prayer, brushing my teeth, and moisturizing. Occasionally I’ll do a facial massage to decrease any puffiness. At bedtime, I always take off my makeup and put moisturizer on,</p></blockquote>
<p>she added.</p>
<blockquote><p>Everyone has days where your skin isn’t looking its best. On a day like that, I still make sure to do my regular [beauty] routine, but it really depends on what I have going on that day that determines how I treat it.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>If I’m going out or at a photo shoot or have a performance,</p></blockquote>
<p>the Sweet Escape singer continued.</p>
<blockquote><p>I might switch out the type of foundation or concealer I use for something with a little more coverage. If I’m home with my family, I keep my routine simple and just embrace it and let it be.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rock singer also said that one of the main reasons her skin looks so young is that she loves sunscreen and never leaves the house without putting it on.</p>
<blockquote><p>I would tell my younger self to stay out of the sun and wear sunscreen. I was a lifeguard when I was younger and I grew up at the beach in Orange County. We didn’t really know that the sun could do the damage it does to our skin. I was lucky though, in my 20s I stopped sunbathing.</p></blockquote>
