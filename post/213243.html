<p>Marty McFly (Fox), played by Michael J. Fox, is seen in the first Back to the Future film being sent 30 years into the past by accident by his friend, the mad scientist Dr. Brown (Lloyd).</p>
<p>The movie was a smashing hit when it was first released in 1985, and it paved the way for two successful sequels in which Fox and Lloyd&#8217;s duo traveled to the year 2015 and then to the Wild West. Both of these films were huge box-office successes.</p>

<p>During their conversation at the New York Comic Con, which took place 37 years after the first time Fox and Lloyd shared the screen together, both actors had nothing but kind words to say about one another.</p>
<p>Fox said that &#8220;the best part of this movie was working with Chris,&#8221;, adding that they had &#8220;immediate chemistry&#8221; when they first met back in the 1980s, perÂ <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-11296571/Back-Futures-Christopher-Lloyd-Michael-J-Fox-reunite-Comic-New-York.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DailyMail.com</a>.</p>
<p>Many people were overjoyed to see the two of them back together again. One person posted a video clip of the event to Twitter with the following caption: &#8220;Watching [Fox] hug Christopher Lloyd like this is so beautiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This made me cry. Beautiful hugging each other,&#8221; another tweeted.</p>

<p>Others of Fox&#8217;s fans were anxiously awaiting an update on his health. The actor, who was only 29 years old at the time, received a diagnosis of Parkinson&#8217;s disease with early onset shortly after the release of the third Back to the Future film in 1990.</p>
<p>In an interview with <span style="color: #00ccff"><a style="color: #00ccff" href="https://people.com/tv/michael-j-fox-reveals-struggle-memorization-skills-crucial-for-acting/">People</a></span> from the year 2020, Fox discussed how the disease impacts both his personal life and his professional life.</p>

<p>&#8220;My short-term memory is shot,&#8221; he explained, adding: &#8220;I always had a real proficiency for lines and memorization. And I had some extreme situations where the last couple of jobs I did were actually really word-heavy parts. I struggled during both of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Comic Con, he discussed his health and talked about the work that his foundation, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, is doing to help those in need.</p>
<p>&#8220;Parkinson&#8217;s has brought people who are still coming in, but it&#8217;s a gift, and I wouldn&#8217;t trade it for anything. People like Chris have meant so much to me, and so many of you have too,&#8221; he said.</p>
