			<p>When we think of big brands, we imagine they have the best products and the best prices, but does that mean you always should buy from them? Maybe not!</p>
<p>In a recent Reddit thread, people shared the unethical brands that they refuse to buy from and why. The answers are pretty eye-opening!</p>
<h2>1. Ticketmaster</h2>
<blockquote class="lstp2"><p>“Pearl Jam tried to sue them back in the day. No success. “Hey buy this concert ticket for 50 bucks” … “Processing fee is $3000 and your firstborn.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>2. Lumber Liquidators</h2>
<blockquote class="lstp2"><p>“They keep getting caught poaching endangered trees for hardwood flooring.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>3. Nestlé</h2>
<blockquote class="lstp2"><p>“Ever since they said water isn’t a human right, I’ve tried to avoid Nestlé products but it’s hard: they’re everywhere and sometimes you don’t realize that a brand is a subsidiary of Nestlé.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>4. Zara</h2>
<blockquote class="lstp2"><p>“They’re disgusting. They straight up steal designs and ideas from small businesses and refuse to give credit or pay for what they’ve taken. Their clothing is overpriced poor quality garbage.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>5. Walmart</h2>
<blockquote class="lstp2"><p>“I work for a small transport company so I’ve seen how they bully small companies with fines for like, everything if you don’t do things their way. Plus they also have a lot of internal stories about terrible employee treatment.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>6. Amazon</h2>
<blockquote class="lstp2"><p>“I’m really trying to stop shopping on Amazon. It’s tough. I live in a pretty rural area and I’m not shopping in stores at all lately, but I’m finding substitute vendors for things I can’t do without…”</p></blockquote>
<h2>7. Any Multilevel Marketing (MLM) company</h2>
<blockquote class="lstp2"><p>“Seriously MLMs are trash. They treat their ‘employees’ like garbage.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>7. Lenovo</h2>
<blockquote class="lstp2"><p>“It seems every year they are either putting malicious code or conveniently overlooked security backdoors into their hardware. And when called out on it, their response is “Was that wrong? Should we not have done that?”</p></blockquote>
<h2>9. Chiquita Brands International</h2>
<blockquote class="lstp2"><p>“Because it’s the continuation of the infamous United Fruit Company. United Fruit Company is the company that engineered a massacre of striking workers in Colombia.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>10. Sinful Colors Nail Polish</h2>
<blockquote class="lstp2"><p>“10+ years back my sister told me about how they took her friends nail art pictures and used them for marketing purposes. She asked them to either give her credit or take them down and they refused.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>11. Fashion Nova</h2>
<blockquote class="lstp2"><p>“Fast fashion is a HUGE issue. They exploit workers overseas enduring horrible conditions for very little pay and they also significantly hurt the environment.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>12. Dollskill</h2>
<blockquote class="lstp2"><p>“I used to work at the SF Headquarters. Can confirm, it’s awful.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>13. Anything Kardashian/Jenner</h2>
<blockquote class="lstp2"><p>“Makeup, shape wear, whatever else they’re peddling. I refuse to give that awful family one red cent.”</p></blockquote>
