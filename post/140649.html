<h2>In culinary school, every single chef instructor says the same thing: If it&#8217;s misspelled on the menu, that&#8217;s on purpose. It&#8217;s so they don&#8217;t have to sell you the real thing. A prime example is &#8216;krab cakes&#8217;</h2>

<h2 class="heading">If a restaurant has a one-page menu, that&#8217;s usually a pretty good sign. It means their line cooks have become specialists and can usually nail all the dishes listed. Conversely, if a restaurant has a giant, multi-page menu, that&#8217;s a gigantic red flag </h2>

<h2 class="heading">We have a sushi place me where the chef gives you free samples of future dishes. This usually means they take pride in their work and want to see peoples reactions before committing it to the menu. </h2>

<h2 class="heading">I always look for how the staff interact with each other. If they all seem to enjoy being there, and coordinate well, more often than not it&#8217;s because everything is running smoothly and they have a good system, which usually means they know what they&#8217;re doing and you can expect good food </h2>

<h2>This is late but I clean kitchen exhaust systems. If you walk in a restaurant and can smell grease walk out. That means the place isn’t clean. From the exhaust system to cooking equipment.</p>
<p>We clean some places where grease drips off the hoods onto cooking surfaces. <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-140669 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/11-54.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="937" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/11-54.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/11-54-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2 class="heading">If employees try to argue with you about food quality in order to dissuade you from sending something under cooked back, just leave. It means they have a cook who can&#8217;t take criticism and your chances at getting a sneezer are greatly increased. </h2>

<h2 class="heading">Watch the wait staff. If the majority of them seem disgruntled or upset, things probably aren&#8217;t great. They probably don&#8217;t care about your food if they aren&#8217;t being treated fairly. </h2>

<h2 class="heading">When my boss (the owner) used to host and people would complain to her about the hour wait on Saturday night at 7pm and then threaten to leave, she would tell them, &#8220;If the restaurant you choose does not have a wait on a Saturday night, you may not want to eat there.&#8221; And then turn her biggest sh*t-eating grin on them </h2>

<h2>Pastry chef here. As much as people say avoid specials, I can&#8217;t speak for everyone but at least in desserts/breakfast pastries, if you see something new its worth trying. Chances are it&#8217;s something the chef has been working on for weeks on their own time, there&#8217;s a lot of love and effort put into it.</p>
<p>Also, the standby if the menu is a book, it&#8217;s probably not great.</p>
<p>The biggest thing to keep an eye on though imo is the staff. If there&#8217;s pissed off people, get out as fast as you can obviously. If everyone is kinda apathetic and not talking to each other much, get out. That&#8217;s also a shitty environment, everyone is probably really passive aggressive, and that&#8217;s going to show. If people seem genuinely good with being there even if it&#8217;s busy or if there&#8217;s playful ragging going on, that&#8217;s where you want to be. The better the staff gets along, the better everything in the place runs. <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-140680 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/16-54.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="774" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/16-54.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/16-54-271x300.jpg 271w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
