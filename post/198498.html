However, at that time, they were both in a relationship. Reynolds was married to Scarlett Johansson, while Lively was dating Penn Badgley. This made their meeting a bit inconvenient, but still, they didn’t know that the universe had different plans for them.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The now-44-year-old Reynolds and 33-year-old Lively were first linked in October 2011. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">They started dating and their first date was at a </span><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a37192579/blake-lively-and-ryan-reynolds-recreated-their-first-date-from-10-years-ago/"><span style="font-weight: 400">sushi restaurant</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.

While no one saw it coming, it was the perfect moment for the couple to declare their love and sincerity toward one another both to their families and friends and eventually to the public.&#8221;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Best friends and lovers merged into one family.</strong></h2>

And one way to prove this is that, despite the couple’s hectic schedules, Reynolds spends a lot of time with his wife and they can’t get enough of each other’s love and affection.&#8221;</span></p>

I’d never known anything like the friendship that I had with him. I could like him as much as I loved him.” Behind the trolls, there’s unconditional love.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;When they have to do any <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1208546/watch-ryan-reynolds-gush-over-his-family-in-must-see-interview-with-mario-lopezs-kids#:~:text=%22I%20just%20try%20to%20be%20as%20present%20as%20possible%2C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">filming</a>, they apparently refuse to be apart from each other, so it’s more like they take turns.<br />
According to Reynolds, “I just try to be as present as possible. We don’t split up like I shoot movies and my wife shoots movies and we go travel all over the place and we just all go together. I think that’s been the best part of it is that we really don’t spend a lot of time apart.” This gives both of them equal time for their children and strengthens the bond between them.&#8221;</p>
