			<p>Do you believe in miracles? If not, then today we have a story for you that would 100% melt your hearts. The character in our story is of a girl. Her parents could not afford her ball gown, leaving any choice for her to miss out on her big day.</p>
<p>Her bother, Maverick Francisco Oyao, stepped ahead to take the responsibility of making her dress for the prom with all the material he could manage. He shared the process of making the dress on Facebook which got incredible popularity. We believe in happy ending after seeing their story.</p>

<p>It all started when the school announced the upcoming junior and senior prom.</p>

<p>Maverick Francisco saw that his parents could not afford the dress for his sister. This made him think and decide that he would take the efforts for making her sister&#8217;s prom memorable. He was struggling to complete the dress and even decided to give up mid-way. However, seeing his sister sad, he started his work again and pulled it off with great dignity and confidence.</p>

<p>“This was my first day. I was nervous and didn’t know where to start. I cut out 9 pieces of blue fabric, decorated them with a satin ribbon, and sewed them all together to make a skirt.”</p>

<div class="_2r__xiKDurulGZmkq4_dl">
<p>“I painted an ombré blue bodice to fit in with the color pallet of the lower part of the dress. I would come home from school and work on it. Sometimes I’d get extremely tired, but by imagining the outcome, I got the energy to continue the hard work.”</p>
<h2>The Sleeves Look&#8217;s like Wings of a Butterfly!</h2>

<p>“And here I am with my sister. I didn’t expect to finish it in time. I even doubted if I could do this or not because the concept was different from what I was already doing. I’m happy to see my sister happy.”</p>
