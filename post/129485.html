			<p>All kids are the same. When the children are in their growing years, they have a curiosity for knowing things. There always want to make their own choices and don&#8217;t even know what they do without knowing its cause. When you ask them what is it that they don&#8217;t like or why did they put cheese in between their toes, the answer would be, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know.&#8217; Kids do not make sense and they need not explain their logic. It&#8217;s their age to explore and have fun until they know what life is all about.</p>
