			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes, it seems like dogs just don’t understand the concept of hiding. Its like they think no one would see them if they close their eyes. And this thing makes us wonder “what are dogs up to?”. It&#8217;s like they think some magical power will make them invisible if they simply shut their eyes. But unfortunately, they get busted. Oh, no. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the dogs are trying hard to hide behind curtains and some are so effortlessly hiding behind toilet paper. But whatever, at least they are trying their hardest to hide behind anything. So we should not be too hard on them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to see how creatively dogs are hiding, you can just scroll down. But remember that you can’t find ‘em all…&#8230;can you?</span></p>
