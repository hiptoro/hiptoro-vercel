			<p>One of the world&#8217;s finest actors was Alan Rickman. Rickman was one of the funniest and most generous men in the film. Many of Rickman&#8217;s costars have come forward to discuss their memories of him. These recollections show his complexity and depth, good humor, and unfettered kindness.</p>
<p>Alan Sidney Patrick Rickman was born in London. He graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and was a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Roles in films as varied as Sense and Sensibility, Love Actually, and Sweeney Todd followed movie stardom. The barber on Fleet Street is a demon. His most famous role was in the Harry Potter movie franchise as Severus Snape a.k.a. Professor Snape.</p>
<p>In 2016 Rickman passed away. Canongate will publish Rickman&#8217;s 27 diaries as a single book in 2022, according to The Guardian. He started writing his diaries in the 1990s, and they contain his thoughts on politics, theater, and more, as well as behind-the-scenes stories from the Harry Potter franchise and other films.</p>
