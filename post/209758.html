			<h2>Why wouldn&#8217;t you love cats?</h2>
<p>I am well aware that not everyone enjoys cats, but those who do are somewhat obsessed with them. Why else would they not be? According to a study conducted 20 years ago, cats are not just adorable; they also help people feel less stressed. Research indicates that cat owners are 40% less likely to pass away from a heart attack, and I don&#8217;t know about you, but I like that statistic. Funny enough, there are more than 80 million cats in America alone, coming in second to fish, despite the fact that many people prefer dogs.</p>
<p>Because of this, even if you don&#8217;t own a cat, you can still enjoy its antics by gazing upon some of the cutest felines. A cat looks good at all times, whether they are yawning or making a mess. By scrolling down, you can take a look for yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Simply put, the dog doesn&#8217;t want anyone to harm his youngster.</h2>

<p>After seeing these photos, do you really want a cat? We wouldn&#8217;t be the ones to prevent you, then. However, caring for a pet is a big responsibility, so no one should do it until they are certain they can handle it. However, nothing prevents you from browsing our website and viewing more cat-related content similar to this one.</p>
