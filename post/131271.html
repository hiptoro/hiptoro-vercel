<p>This little guy is almost 3 yeras old and has a rare condition called Pituitary Dwarfism. Unlinke other dogs of this breed who tend to grown majestic, this one still look like a puppy.</p>
<h2>Look at this little baby with it’s big ears!</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-131288 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-202.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1350" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-202.jpg 1080w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-202-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-202-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-202-768x960.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /></p>
<p>Ranger will never grown in size for his entire life He was first diagnosed with the  condition due to an infection called Giardia. It is usually caused by a parasite.</p>
<h2>Such a good little boy!</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-131290 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-208.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="876" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-208.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-208-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>His owners think that he has this rare condition because of his parents, this is what they had to say. “When we originally got Ranger from the breeder, he was smaller than all his other littermates, but we figured that was because he had a parasite called Coccidia,”</p>
<h2>It’s hard to believe this one is 3 years old!</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-131293 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-205.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="919" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-205.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-205-300x269.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-205-768x689.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>“In the weeks following, we took him home and he was parasite free but later on ended up getting a parasite called Giardia. At the same time, we also discovered that Ranger had a large infection on his neck. We were eventually able to get the infection under control, fast forward a few months later we were finally able to get rid of Giardia.”</p>
<h2>I’m not a little guy, I’m a big guy. I don’t need no toys mom!</h2>

<h2>Endless cuddles for Ranger.</h2>

<p>The condition in dogs is caused because of the thyroid disorder that causes the thyroid glands to stop producing or not produce enough hormones. Because of this, the poor fellow had to suffer from hair loss and poor skin. But thankfully, he is being treated and managed by medication.</p>
<h2>He’s not the only sibling!</h2>
