			<p>An animal shelter in Michigan says it received an &#8220;overwhelming response&#8221; from the community after inviting children to read to the dogs and cats in their care as part of the READing Paws program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Some researches prove that it&#8217;s a therapy to read to shelter pets.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-176091" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/40Gpjc4Y95wCGWLdHfbV.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/40Gpjc4Y95wCGWLdHfbV.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/40Gpjc4Y95wCGWLdHfbV-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a classic win-win scenario for kids and pets alike. Children can practice their literacy skills, while calm and quiet attention can have a significant calming effect on pets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>So the Ingham County Animal Shelter and Control had young readers between the ages of 6 and 16.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-176092" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/VEpxstXLJ7nZDPzcfS20.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/VEpxstXLJ7nZDPzcfS20.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/VEpxstXLJ7nZDPzcfS20-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The shelter environment can be overwhelming for many pets. We have found that reading to our residents reduces anxiety and creates a calm environment,&#8221; they wrote in a post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>They even requested books for children who wished to volunteer.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-176094" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/d6xFMUBBMyTzeHcr3Wvf.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="873" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/d6xFMUBBMyTzeHcr3Wvf.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/d6xFMUBBMyTzeHcr3Wvf-220x300.jpg 220w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Of course, children can also bring their own favorites to read to the puppies and kittens. They just have to have a parent or guardian with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Turns out, the shelter needs to find a way to accommodate a bunch of little readers who want to help out.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-176097" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mzH5SubczWtkXkQeV4hH.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mzH5SubczWtkXkQeV4hH.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mzH5SubczWtkXkQeV4hH-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The slots for 45 minutes filled up very fast. The kids really wanted to read to the pets!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Updating its post, the shelter wrote that &#8220;due to an overwhelming response of interest to our program, we hope to announce future dates soon.&#8221;</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-176098" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4p64FPpr8FDfhnik4WYC.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="768" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4p64FPpr8FDfhnik4WYC.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4p64FPpr8FDfhnik4WYC-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4p64FPpr8FDfhnik4WYC-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4p64FPpr8FDfhnik4WYC-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>Hoping that the young reader and pets find time for each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A lot of people took different initiatives to support the shelter.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-176099" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/C9y1Alt63VYffun6GCPj.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="588" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/C9y1Alt63VYffun6GCPj.jpg 480w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/C9y1Alt63VYffun6GCPj-245x300.jpg 245w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>As the post spread on Facebook, book deals came in, and teachers and groups like Girl Scout troops expressed interest in taking their positions to read with the animals as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The bad news is that if you&#8217;re in the area, you might have to wait for your turn to read.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-176100" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5Wtk495sm9IftgiP9Pda.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5Wtk495sm9IftgiP9Pda.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5Wtk495sm9IftgiP9Pda-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>But the good news is that READing Paws, which has a stated mission to help young readers develop their literacy skills with the help of therapy animals, has groups and events across the country.</p>
<p>I wonder if the same thing is done somewhere with adults who just want to read to dogs.</p>
