<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first is not a cooking tip but a kitchen tip. If you are using a falling knife and you drop it, let it hit the ground. A falling knife does not have any handle. So, if you try to catch it, you will land in an emergency room. </span></p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-115004 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/10-57.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/10-57.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/10-57-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><br />

<h2>11.</h2>

Always pay attention to all your senses. Like when you are multitasking, always trust your nose. If you get a different smell, check the pan from where it is coming.

<h2>13.</h2>
