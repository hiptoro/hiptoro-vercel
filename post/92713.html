			<p>Dogs and humans always have a special bond. And the dogs are so committed that they never leave us in a difficult situation alone. And, in turn, we humans too shower our love on the little furry doggos. The dogs are also smart enough to handle devastating situations seamlessly. In a similar incident, an 11-year-old boy and his dog teamed up to save their neighbor&#8217;s home from a devastating fire.</p>
<p>We know that you are quite shocked about how could such a small kid control the fire. But yes, that&#8217;s true that the little boy and his dog successfully controlled the fire from causing the major losses.</p>
<p>Stacy Boss was quite distressed after the whole incident. She said that she never expected that such a big fire could ever break into her house. The incident happened so fast that the flames consumed major parts of her home. Stacey’s car, garage, and collection of sentimental family heirlooms were gone forever. But according to the lady, these were all replaceable losses and she could get them back. But, what she is happy about is her home was saved. Also, she and her beloved family members were all saved.</p>
<h3>Stacy thanked the boy and his dog for their heroic deed</h3>

<p>Stacy thanked the little boy and his dog who were her neighbors. The little munchkins took prompt action and helped to stop the fire. Stacy also said that the 11-year-old neighbor, David&#8217;s work was so heroic that it could not be expressed in words.</p>
<p>However, David said that he could not have done all this without the help of his dog, Chewy. Thus, the boy and his dog are an inspiration for all of us. This shows that no matter, how complex a problem is, our will to solve it can only bring success to us. Also, we should keep good care of our dogs. As they are our best companions.
