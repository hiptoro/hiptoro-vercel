			<p>Most children consider their parents to be their superheroes. But that isn&#8217;t the case with all. Some parents are cool with their children, and today&#8217;s story is about one such cool mom. Jimmy&#8217;s mom is very supportive and cool. She defines how parents can manage the pressure of parenthood in a better way.</p>
<p>Well, Jimmy&#8217;s mom who is about to become a grandparent has more responsibility to draw lines. When the son-in-law demanded to set up a nursery for the grandkid at the cost of compromising her son&#8217;s room, she had to take a  tough call. The conversation did not end well at all. Scroll down to know what happened next.</p>
<h2>While sharing a room with a sibling isn’t all that bad, sharing it once you’re already a teen, let alone already had one is a bummer</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-193447 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-8.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="469" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-8.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-8-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>So, a woman recently came out sharing her story with Am I The A-Hole community on Reddit. She was wondering to get a response on whether she was wrong to say no to setting up a nursery for her soon-to-arrive grandchild replacing one of her sons’ rooms.</p>
<p>The story talks about sharing details of her daughter Avery and son-in-law, Tom. They are expecting their firstborn and are wholeheartedly invested in the process. It sometimes even gets difficult to explain the many things at this point.</p>
<p>So, the soon-to-be parents were visiting grandma and had the conversations. Tom asked if she had emptied one of the rooms to be transformed into a nursery. OP was confused. Tom explained that they were expecting a yes from her. Again, OP was confused. Even more so at this point.</p>
<h2>This mom tried to protect her two sons from having to share a room, all because the older sister and her hubby decided one of their rooms ought to be used as a nursery</h2>

<p>It turns out that grandparents are expected to prepare a nursery at their homes to welcome their grandchildren as now they have an additional member in the family. Tom provided some examples of this happening. He further went and even pointed out that his parents have been kind enough to already have agreed and made one.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that OP&#8217;s in-laws are financially more stable than her and can afford the space and money to build an individual nursery. The soon-to-be grandma explained that she can&#8217;t do what&#8217;s being asked of her because there is no spare, nor the money for an individualized nursery. But according to Tom, the grandmom must make sure the grandkid has everything they need whenever the family is visiting. The daughter seemed to agree with him.</p>

<p>After the back-and-forth, OP’s daughter jumped in, suggesting she move her older teenage son (16) to live in one room with the younger one (14). Jimmy&#8217;s mother was against this, and she had a valid point explaining that the sons are old enough to have separate rooms. Tom objected, saying that the boys could live together in a room and share the space.</p>
<p>The conversation turned into an argument, whereby Avery accused her mother of not caring about them, or the grandchild and left. And it didn&#8217;t take long for the dad to catch wind of this and ended up supporting Tom and Avery. He started accusing her, saying that she is favoring the boys as always. OP, however, was convinced that the daughter and husband were making a bit too unreasonable a request.</p>

<p>Tom offered to cover the nursery setup expense, but the mother was not ready to accept it. She thought that setting up a nursery for her grandchild who would visit occasionally is unnecessary. And as far as the sons are concerned, they&#8217;ll be forced to live together. So, she turned to the AITA community for some perspective.</p>
<p>And perspective the community delivered was in support of her. The community ruled that she was right by choosing not to compromise her son&#8217;s room. It wasn&#8217;t only the reason for the grandchild visiting the home occasionally. But also the fact that it isn&#8217;t common for grandparents to make a dedicated nursery for the child.</p>
<p>Some parents on Reddit argued that it was also normal for the parents to bring everything with them everywhere. Plain and simple. Yet others pointed out just how entitled, and somewhat arrogant, it all was. In fact, some suspected they will want to ‘dump’ the baby on everyone else.</p>
<h3>The internet was having none of it, and decided that the woman was not wrong to not allow for a nursery</h3>
