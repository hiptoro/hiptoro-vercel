			<p>Dogs always have a special corner in our hearts. What&#8217;s more amazing about the little canines is that they always try to love their human friends in every possible way. But unfortunately, the life expectancy of the dogs is not so much. And thus, they leave us lonely very soon. But, this news will definitely make your day. As the oldest golden retriever celebrated her miraculous 20th birthday for the first time in history.</p>
<p>Generally, golden retrievers have a lifespan of 12-14 years. So, we usually try to spend those special years with them. And now luckily, we have the oldest golden retriever that is aged 20 years. August, aka Augie was born on April 24, 2000. The little fury oldest golden retriever had a struggling start in her life as she was rehomed twice. And the little dog couldn&#8217;t find her forever home till she was 14 years old. Then, Jennifer and Steve Hetterscheidt of Oakland, Tennessee adopted this oldest golden retriever.</p>

<p>Augie lives with three golden retriever siblings in the family. The family members told despite her advancing age and some kidney issues, she’s “surprisingly healthy” and still goes for daily walks. This April, the oldest retriever, August celebrated her 20th birthday. She enjoyed a birthday party at home with her family and a carrot <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/husband-gifts-wife-a-birthday-cake-which-looks-like-her-favorite-thing-a-big-amazon-package/">cake</a>.</p>

<p>Little Augie knew that she actually made history by passing 20. She became the oldest golden retriever in history! Nearly doubling the normal lifespan of a retriever. And this is what makes her a true inspiration for all.</p>

<p>This story filled our eyes with tears and we were actually very happy to know that the dogs too can live their youth. Thus, we can get to spend more time with our little furry friends. If you also have any inspirational stories, do share them with us in the comments section below.</p>
