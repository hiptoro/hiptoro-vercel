			<p>Some people are still unaware of the existence of the LGBTQ+ community in this day and age. These people pretend that people who are lesbian, gay, bi, trans, and queer don&#8217;t exist on planet earth. They are ignorant of the challenges that people face.</p>
<p>There are times when straight people forget that people of the same sex are part of society.</p>
<p>Silva Neves, an <a href="https://www.silvaneves.co.uk/">Accredited</a> Therapist, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Compulsive-Sexual-Behaviours-Silva-Neves/dp/0367465485?tag=vilofjoy-20">Author</a> from the UK explained why some people pretend that the LGBTQ+ community doesn&#8217;t exist and went into detail about discrimination, homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia they still have to deal with in 2022. For some people, ignoring the existence of LGBTQ+ is to stay comfortable in their own lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. For people who are afraid to tell their doctors about their sexuality. We are taught to keep our opinions to ourselves.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-196685" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-62334bd78b535__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="603" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-62334bd78b535__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/1-62334bd78b535__700-300x258.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;People pretend the LGBTQ+ people don&#8217;t exist because it is easier to stay with pre-conceived ideas of what they think they know about human beings. People still believe that being heterosexual is the only &#8216;normal&#8217; and everything else is &#8216;weird,'&#8221; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/silvanevespsychotherapy/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">psychotherapist Silva</a> told.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ignoring the existence of the LGBTQ+ people is a way to stay comfortable with their own lives and not open to the diversity of humanity. Opening up to the diversity of sexual orientations requires being open to &#8216;not knowing and being curious enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. IKR?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-196684" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-62334c17a51bc__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="788" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-62334c17a51bc__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-62334c17a51bc__700-266x300.jpg 266w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many challenges for the LGBTQ+ people in the West. Silva said that these differ from country to country. Western countries are as liberal and progressive as their neighbors.</p>
<p>&#8220;For example, in the UK, the LGBTQ+ people have legal rights and are protected by law under its discrimination act. However, some other European countries, such as Poland, have strong anti-LGBTQ+ rights and therefore people are not protected in that country, worse, some are even hunted,&#8221; Silva gave an example of how two different European countries see the same community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Stole The Rainbow.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-196683" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6231fa96a9702_qbfuk2slynw71__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="917" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6231fa96a9702_qbfuk2slynw71__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6231fa96a9702_qbfuk2slynw71__700-229x300.jpg 229w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>

<h2>4. Oh Brad You Poor Thing, I&#8217;m Jus Really Gay.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-196682" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-62334cc4e775e__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="481" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-62334cc4e775e__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-62334cc4e775e__700-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Silva warned that having legal rights in the UK doesn&#8217;t mean that there is no discrimination. &#8220;Unfortunately, there is still much homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia. There are numerous reports of LGBTQ+ people being attacked only for holding the hand of their same gender partner in the streets, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continued: &#8220;One of the main opposition to LGBTQ+ people is religious beliefs as many religious people do not agree with accepting LGBTQ+ people as equal human beings. Many LGBTQ+ people are rejected by their own families when they come out. Some can feel very isolated. Because LGBTQ+ people are still ostracised in our societies, they tend to develop poor mental health and misuse of alcohol and drugs as coping strategies.&#8221;</p>

<h2>7. They&#8217;ll Be Pals. Gal Pals.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-196679" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/5-62334efb6c65d__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="470" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/5-62334efb6c65d__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/5-62334efb6c65d__700-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He told that homophobia can be explained by a person&#8217;s upbringing. The beliefs and values that one&#8217;s family members hold can influence how an individual thinks as they grow up. This isn&#8217;t the whole story. Things are more complicated than that.</p>
<p>“If people grew up with homophobic parents and they haven’t been exposed to different opinions, they are more likely to be homophobic themselves. Most religions promote the inaccurate idea that same-sex relationships and sexual behaviors are unnatural, wrong, against their God, and a sin,” Silva explained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>8. Ultimate Gal Pals.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-196678" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6231f198c31f1_e3o8mc3e9j571__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="841" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6231f198c31f1_e3o8mc3e9j571__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6231f198c31f1_e3o8mc3e9j571__700-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Even recently, the Pope declared that same-sex marriages were not endorsed by the Church. Islam is also very homophobic. Most Islamic countries have anti-gay laws with punishment ranging from imprisonment to the death penalty. Many people in the UK growing up in such households are more likely to be homophobic,” the mental health expert pointed out that homophobia is still very prevalent in modern times.</p>
<p>Some younger people want to be part of the crowd and follow their friends and peers. They might start taking on a negative outlook when it comes to the LGBTQ+ community just to fit in with their social circle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Teenagers can be homophobic as a way to conform to heterosexuality and be more accepted by their peers,” Silva said.</p>
<p>The therapist said that some people become homophobic because they try to deny that they have same-sex attractions.</p>
<p>“In being homophobic they attempt to repress their own feelings by fighting against the source of their arousal: the LGBTQ people,” he said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of whether somebody had been living under an allegorical stone, it&#8217;s still staggeringly challenging to miss the presence of the LGBTQ+ people group. Pride Month, generally held in June (however on different months in certain nations), is a period for occasions that advance the local area&#8217;s battle for respect, uniformity, and equity. It is additionally a chance to cause to notice the issues that a few individuals from the local area battle with, including separation.</p>
<p>An organization from the United Kingdom spoke about the importance of Pride during an interview. The goal of Stonewall is to create a world where all members of the LGBTQ+ community are free to be themselves and live their lives to the fullest.</p>

<p>According to the Director of Communications and External Affairs at &#8216;Stonewall,&#8217; Pride Month is an annual way for everyone to show their support for the LGBTQ+ crowd. It is a global phenomenon.</p>
<p>“Pride is an opportunity for all of us to come together in celebration, protest, and solidarity with lesbian, gay, bi, and trans communities all over the world,” de Santos told us about the extent to which Pride is celebrated each and every year.</p>

<p>“All lesbian, gay, bi, trans, and queer people should be able to thrive as themselves, but in 2021, LGBTQ+ people are still being held back because of who we are,” he explained to us previously that even though there’s a lot of progress, there are plenty of challenges that yet remain to be tackled.</p>
