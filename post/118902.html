			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you want to know whether your dog has done something suspicious and naughty? Well, just take a closer look and see if your dog is silent? Is he keeping his head down? And is he pressing his tail hard against his body? If yes, you have found your culprit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on this thing, a famous Facebook group called “Dogspotting Society” has asked people to submit pictures of their naughty dogs. And the results are hilarious. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to see what the naughty girls and bois are up to this week, keep scrolling. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We even talked to Kate Mornement, an animal consultant, and behaviorist. Kate said, “the guilty look often involves dogs showing the whites of their eyes, lip licking, avoiding eye contact, tucking their tail, holding their ears back flat against their head, cowering, and sometimes hiding from the owner.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kate explained that while “guilt is a human concept, dogs are known to share other emotions in common with us, such as fear, anxiety, joy, and anticipation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Guilt will be added to this list; however, we&#8217;ll have to wait for the science to prove it one way or another.” As for now, &#8220;researchers are trying to establish whether dogs actually feel guilty when caught out or whether they&#8217;re just responding to our behavior and body language and being scolded.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>I made a beautiful carrot cake for my mum&#8217;s birthday in October. I left the kitchen for literally 2minutes and came back to a pile of crumbs I wonder who the culprit was.</p>

<p>This morning while my owner slept I ate 2 bags of freeze-dried chicken hearts (60 or more) 2 bags of Raw coated biscuits. 1 bag of the freeze-dried liver. 12 dental chews size small. 3/4 of a yak chew bone. 1/4 of a 3kg bag of dry dog food. The farts are just starting&#8230;</p>

<p>My Doberman Django chewed through his lead, now he is Django Unchained.</p>
<p>A spokesperson of the Dogspotting Society said, “most of them based on universal experiences, so many people can interact with one another. Some of the other challenges we’ve seen are #ThenAndNow challenge, #WhatWasYourDogMistakenFor challenge,#SmilingDog challenge, and #UnflatteringDogPhoto challenge, just to name a few!&#8221;</p>
<p>“With so many people working from home, you’ll have more time to bond with your new best friend! We know this year has been very difficult for a lot of our members and the challenges have added a bit of levity for everyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Max first came to live with us, he was an expert kitchen burglar. He stole cakes, buns, entire loaves of bread, cocoa powder, cheeseburgers, packets of biscuits &#8211; as well as a bunch of non-edibles like pizza boxes, sweet wrappers, cigarette filters, and wet wipes. We had a crash course in keeping things out of his reach. The habit is so ingrained that we still do it now, even though he crossed the rainbow bridge last month. Hope you’re eating all the chocolate cake you can, Maxi! We miss you.</p>

<p>After escaping her crate, Gidget decided that the bedroom door sounded like a tasty treat.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, she doesn&#8217;t have anxiety about being in her crate at all and actually kinda likes it in there, but I think once she got out of it she panicked cause she couldn&#8217;t get back in there and the door to the room was closed, and since she could see the rest of the house through the doorknob hole she was just trying to get out there.</p>
