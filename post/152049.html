			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After giving our 100% and sometimes even more, we expect the same in return. But most of the time we are disappointed. Just as </span><span style="font-weight: 400">mom-of-one Aaliyah Cortez from Austin, Texas, is disappointed seeing her biweekly paycheck. After working for 70 hours at the local sports bar, she just received  $9.28.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She took to her TikTok account and shared a video explaining everything. </span></p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">At the beginning of the clip, she shares the details of her paycheck, including how many hours she worked over the span of two weeks.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-152053 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-38.jpg" alt="" width="308" height="411" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-38.jpg 308w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-38-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 308px) 100vw, 308px" /></p>
<p>She said she gets paid $2.13 an hour as a bartender and server, and for this particular pay period, she had worked nearly 71 hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have made $151,&#8221; she added.</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">However, after Social Security, Medicare, and federal income tax were taken out of her pay, she was left with $9.28.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-152055 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-37.jpg" alt="" width="304" height="413" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-37.jpg 304w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-37-221x300.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" /></p>
<p>She finished the video by saying, &#8220;This is why you tip.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">The single mom explained that she shared the video to show how the service industry operates.</h2>
<div style="width: 640px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-0-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://v.srgcdn.com/vT5POCrYW3uCizgqmalA.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://v.srgcdn.com/vT5POCrYW3uCizgqmalA.mp4">https://v.srgcdn.com/vT5POCrYW3uCizgqmalA.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&#8220;There are laws set up that allow tipped employees to be paid under the federal minimum wage, which makes us rely on the customer to pay our wages,&#8221; she told <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristatorres/this-moms-paycheck-was-9-for-working-over-70-hou" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buzzfeed</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not right that we have to do this, but I wanted to shed some light on the issue and inform the public about the importance of tipping.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">Restaurants are able to get away with paying servers and bartenders a few dollars by relying on customer tips to top up their paychecks.</h2>
<div style="width: 640px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-0-2" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://v.srgcdn.com/xIOTkOWPoHKPBT1RlQJY.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://v.srgcdn.com/xIOTkOWPoHKPBT1RlQJY.mp4">https://v.srgcdn.com/xIOTkOWPoHKPBT1RlQJY.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>&#8220;If I had a good two weeks from my tips, my check will be on the lower side,&#8221; Cortez explained. &#8220;At my last restaurant, my checks would come out to be $0.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">The system creates uncertainty for servers.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-152057 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5-35.jpg" alt="" width="1059" height="792" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5-35.jpg 1059w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5-35-300x224.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5-35-1024x766.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/5-35-768x574.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1059px) 100vw, 1059px" /></p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">At the end of the day, Cortez said she enjoys her job and is grateful she can make money from tips.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-152059 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-37.jpg" alt="" width="491" height="715" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-37.jpg 491w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-37-206x300.jpg 206w" sizes="(max-width: 491px) 100vw, 491px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I just wish we were all being paid adequately and consistently,&#8221; she said. &#8220;As you can see — by my check — I cannot afford to live off of $2.13 an hour, so I solely rely on the generosity of my customers.&#8221;</p>
<div class="top" data-v-28b10e58="">
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">Cortez&#8217;s video was later shared on Twitter by user @sxbvna where it ignited a pretty heated conversation over the matter of tipping.</h2>
<div class="image-wrapper item-image" data-v-d8f89fec="" data-v-28b10e58="">Some users were shocked to see how little Cortez&#8217;s hourly wage is.</div>

<div class="text-content text" data-v-28b10e58="">
<p>&#8220;This is so wrong,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/StephaniedeJag3/status/1227724406492786689" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one user</a> wrote, while <a href="https://twitter.com/DiddlyDonger/status/1227402388283084800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another</a> added, &#8220;When she said $2.13 an hour I thought there was a typo or something. That&#8217;s just criminal.&#8221;</p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">Some unsympathetic users said Cortez shouldn&#8217;t have agreed to work a job with such a low hourly wage.</h2>

<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">However, others came to Cortez&#8217;s defense and insisted it&#8217;s the industry&#8217;s fault, not her own, for such a low wage.</h2>

<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">Then there were those who pointed out that Cortez&#8217;s paycheck showed she made over $700 in tips during that pay period.</h2>

<h2 class="headline" data-v-28b10e58="">Cortez, however, was quick to defend herself in the comments against those individuals.</h2>
