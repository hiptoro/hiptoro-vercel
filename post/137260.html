<p>Andrea Gaylord was amongst the many Paradise residents ordered to evacuate her home. Because of the fire that spread so rapidly, she was forced to leave behind her two beloved dogs: Madison and Miguel. The pair of beautiful shepherd brothers, who used to watch over the family&#8217;s vast property.</p>
</div>
<p>The women prayed that Madison and Miguel had survived the fires, Andrea reached out to local animal advocate, Shayla Sullivan.</p>
<p>With evacuation orders still in place, Shayla was given permission to search the area and look for the dogs.</p>
<p>Miguel was found by then and so, Shayla focused on searching Madison. She kept, food, water, and scented items of clothing in order for the dog to sniff and come back.</p>
<p>After one month, the evacuation was lifted and finally, they could find Madison.</p>
