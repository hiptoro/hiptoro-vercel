			<p>The artist Ademar Vieira from Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil, shares these very touching stories that anyone will be easily moved by them. His talent is making him a very popular artist on the Internet. His work seems to be very promising as well.</p>
<p>The Brazilian artist was a screenwriter, later, he started to illustrate. So, his stories do have a beautiful blend of visuals and storytelling. He has made quite a few of them, and we can&#8217;t deny that they engaging.  Today we’re focusing on “The Choice.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“The Choice” is about making a crucial decision that changes one’s life forever, however small the opportunity may seem. Every time we make a choice, we leave one timeline aside and enter another. The author juxtaposes and illustrates two diverging universes next to each other that start from the time the protagonist makes a choice to own/not to own a dog. The author said on his Instagram “I dedicate it to all the animals that contribute to our mental health during the quarantine.”</p></blockquote>

<p>He told <strong>Hiptoro</strong> how he started making them: “I started making the strips unpretentiously, just as a way to exorcise my demons during a very difficult phase that I was going through in early 2020 and when I posted, I realized that many people identified with them themselves. I received good feedback and then I continued to expose the things I was feeling and the audience got bigger. When I recovered from the bad phase, we were in the coronavirus pandemic, meaning everyone was going through a bad phase, so I continued to explore the problems people around the world were going through. Now I have used the strips to express my opinions on some issues that I consider relevant, whether personal, social, or political.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-119123 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-114.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" />  <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-119124 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-115.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" /></p>
<p>Ademar gave us details of his recent social media success: “I couldn’t believe it when a comic strip of mine went viral in Latin America in June this year. I received 100 thousand likes and gained 20 thousand followers in one week. Famous people and profiles came to talk to me and congratulate me and that left me in the clouds, but it also brought the weight of responsibility. Now, I was no longer making strips just for me and my friends, people from different countries were also seeing me. I was very happy that the public showed me a path to be followed as an artist and I want to follow that path to see what else is good.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-119138 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/4-114.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" />  <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-119139 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5-112.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" />  <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-119141 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/6-108.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" />  <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-119142 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/7-110.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" />  <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-119143 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/8-110.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" />  <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-119144 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/9-107.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" />  <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-119145 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/10-101.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" /></p>
