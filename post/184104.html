			<p>Christmas is around the corner because the holidays are upon us. It&#8217;s a time for family, a time for lights, and a time for some truly disturbing decorations.</p>
<p>The Christmas decorations below are sure to make the season merry and bright. It will make you laugh as you roast chestnuts around the fire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Wishing you a crappy X-mas.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184106" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/7idCDi01jtSts7DsD7aD.png" alt="" width="640" height="873" /></p>
<p>Mr. Hankey, is that you? Was this photo taken in Colorado? I&#8217;m grasping straws, trying to come up with an explanation as to why a mall would decorate a giant pile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The person who did this must be fired right away.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184107" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blx4H1xJ6rRlvMm6vjtA.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="853" /></p>
<p>It seems that someone was trying to be a little Grinchy and get back at the powers that be by arranging a naughty polar bear scene. Why does the one look like a jacked mouse?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>X-Mas came early this year.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-184108" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pdlYs68zsdg92wSDSwAS.png" alt="" width="613" height="460" /></p>
<p>You know I had to go there. You should not decorate a palm tree during the holiday season. If you live in a climate that doesn&#8217;t have evergreen trees, buy a fake one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s a wreath from hell.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184109" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/9c7oAP3ZNxwXblPyQ4tI.png" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>This wreath is very similar to the one from Tim Burton&#8217;s The Nightmare Before Christmas. The person that tries to eat everyone in the house? If I look away, I feel like this thing will start moving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Are the X-Mas trees or&#8230;</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184110" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/OrKzZZKvQ57iTeQ9rLHL.png" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t be the only one who sees it. Is the holiday shop sure that they didn&#8217;t get a box of inventory sent to them by mistake? I know who I&#8217;d be calling if there was a sex shop in that plaza.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Just gonna have a French toast.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184111" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/VeG3HTGQ003hS6TUDUTX.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="838" /></p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s safe to say that I won&#8217;t be liking pancakes any time soon. You should always have an extra set of eyes to look over your work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My true love gave this to me on the 4th day of Christmas.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184112" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/UPUneome4wBGM1gsDskv.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="360" /></p>
<p>There are four giant pairs of panties. Is the person stringing the lights just not interested? The lights will get people in the mood, but not for Christmas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>You&#8217;re an animal, Santa!</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-184113" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/PFmQLk6oL74AxheuykEF.png" alt="" width="518" height="391" /></p>
<p>Santa did what now? He was wearing a hat. I don&#8217;t know about you, but that sounds like the beginning of a poorly written Dr. Sess book is a rip-off. I think they&#8217;ll be extras come the new year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>There&#8217;s some real workout going on in Santa&#8217;s chimney.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184114" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/kiwEQZOJmnpSMjpPLKkC.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="860" /></p>
<p>Santa is tired and worn down. If you had a bunch of strange kids crawling in and out of your chimney all day, you&#8217;d be a little worse for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s not what you think it is.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-184115" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/rhNmPmFlmeADR1VqEn1i.png" alt="" width="590" height="441" /></p>
<p>Be honest. How many of you thought it was a giant toe, instead of a baby Jesus ornament? The artist might have run out of paint. Brown on brown isn&#8217;t working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Not sure if they&#8217;re headless snowmen or Santa&#8217;s toy bags.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184116" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/vYFousghxslmyS8IMVnV.png" alt="" width="768" height="577" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what these are. You can&#8217;t tell me that they don&#8217;t look like headless snowmen because they are sacks of toys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>These Santas aren&#8217;t spreading a good message.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184117" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/sr2UGENNyTXXgiWC9HOF.png" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>If you know what I mean, these Santas look like they just took a long walk off of a short pier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Santa, is that a corn cob pipe in your pocket?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184118" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/r2dyDDpq9UGW5f2vavwO.png" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<p>What will they come up with next? I know that sounds crude, but is it really that big of a reach? Look at those happy smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Whoever said you can&#8217;t make it to Santa&#8217;s good list, wasn&#8217;t trying hard enough.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184119" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/bTltBcmYkjzDJbezs4HJ.png" alt="" width="640" height="864" /></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything ambiguous or open to interpretation with this one. The elves are having their candy canes looked at in a very suggestive way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What exactly is still seeking him?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-184120" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qCVUdkRChjW0DLNDdGse.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="566" /></p>
<p>It is supposed to say &#8220;Wisemen still seek him&#8221;. You can clearly see that it doesn&#8217;t. This is the kind of thing I would expect to find on my nana&#8217;s front porch. She would be completely unaware.</p>
