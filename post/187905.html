<p>Meet Mama who has been making regular daily trips to the next-door neighbor every day. For a reason, of course. Or better yet, reasons. Mama has realized that whenever she walks to the neighbor’s door she gets cuddles and a bit of food. It was a bit strange in the beginning but has become a daily routine for both.</p>
<h2>2. Mama is looking for her neighbor who gives her food and love on daily basis<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://defused.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2-29.jpg" alt="" width="694" height="793" /></h2>

<p>There’s not a single day that passes without a visit from this cat Mama. The cute white kitty visits the next-door neighbors expecting pets and food, and she’s lucky she gets both. It’s not just Mama that loves it. The neighbor doesn’t mind the visits at all, cuddling with the cat and feeding it straight from his hand.</p>
<h2>4. Oh my God, if this kitty would be on my door I would just kidnap her, why is she soo beautiful?<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://defused.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/4-32.jpg" alt="" width="729" height="661" /></h2>
<p>It’s a daily routine for both of them that take place in the afternoon. Whenever the cat comes by the big window, she knocks on it to attract her neighbor’s attention. He comes out for some cuddles and gives her food in the end.</p>
