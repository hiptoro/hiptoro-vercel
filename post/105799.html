			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we have a dog, we want to include him in everything that we do because we love him so much. Just like us, there is a couple named </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gil and Luna, who also feel the same way. No matter what the occasion is, they just don&#8217;t want to leave behind their furry friends. And their wedding is no exception. When they were planning to marry, they wanted to incorporate their dogs into it. But they were confused about doing it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s because they were looking for something else other than wedding puppy portraits. And hopefully, they came up with a great idea. What they did was they immortalized their dog as part of the topper for their gorgeous wedding cake. The cute Chimney, a 10-year-old Jack Russell Pug mix and Einstein, a 3-year-old Pembroke Welsh Corgi were looking so good on the cake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Gil and Luna charred the pictures of their cute wedding cake, many other people have also started following this trend. And now there are so many options available for people who want to include their precious pups in the cake. They can either have a dog-themed cake,  ring bearing collars, and toppers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scroll down to check out the pictures and don’t forget to tell us would you also like to add your dog to the wedding cake or not.</span></p>
