<p>In a series of messages, the 76-year-old singer said that her 36-year-old boyfriend treats her &#8220;like a queen.&#8221;</p>

<p>In August, Amber posted a statement on Instagram about how upset she was. &#8216;I&#8217;m tired of getting cheated on and being embarrassed behind the scenes.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;All 12 of y&#8217;all bums (the ones that I know of there&#8217;s probably more) can have him&#8217; she continued. &#8216;Y&#8217;all very much knew he was in a relationship with a baby and y&#8217;all decided to f**k him anyway. I saw all the texts and DM&#8217;s. Y&#8217;all were well aware but y&#8217;all don&#8217;t owe me any loyalty so it&#8217;s whatever.&#8217;</p>
<p>A few days later, Alexander admitted to cheating on her and said that cheating was his &#8220;true nature,&#8221; even though he &#8220;loved&#8221; her.</p>
<p>Alexander is the Vice President of Def Jam&#8217;s Artists and Repertoire Department, which has signed Rihanna, Justin Bieber, 2 Chainz, DMX, and Jhene Aiko, among others.</p>
<p>Alexander was born in 1986 in Oakland, California, and he has been on an episode of &#8220;Keeping Up with the Kardashians.&#8221;</p>
