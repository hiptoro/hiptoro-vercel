			<p>If you ever been to the San Francisco area, you will probably recall your memories of the Alcatraz Prison. It is an intriguing site that leaves a great impression on our minds after we see it from the Golden Gate Bridge. This prison was the most dangerous until 1963. And it is known for housing some most notorious criminals from the United States.</p>
<p>As the Alcatraz Prison was located on the island, it was almost difficult for anyone to survive there. Also, it is quite impossible for any criminal to escape from this isolated prison. Although about three dozen prisoners tried to escape, all of them failed miserably.</p>

<p>But, you&#8217;ll be shocked to know that the three brothers Clarence Anglin, John Anglin and Frank Morris are believed to be the closest ones. The brothers spent several months working to widen their prisoner cells&#8217; ventilation ducts. And they used a variety of tools to accomplish this task.</p>
<h3>#1 The mind-blowing escape plan</h3>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-89628" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/alcatraz3.jpg" alt="The mind-blowing escape plan" width="650" height="535" /></p>
<p>Frank played accordion in his cell to hide the noise that was made. They used paint and cardboard to receiver the ducts. And as soon as they moved out of their cells, they started the construction of the raft. They stitched about fifty raincoats to make the raft that would take them to freedom.</p>
<h3>#2 They placed dummy heads in the Alcatraz</h3>

<p>The smart brothers even placed dummy heads in their Alcatraz prison to fool the guards and <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/30-pictures-which-show-the-other-side-of-protests/">policemen</a>. They had even taken the real hair from the prisoner barber. And at this time, they made their descendant into the raft. But the people believed that they had drowned during their escape attempt. FBI even discovered the remnants of the raft that indicated the end of the story.</p>
<h3>#3 But, the story does not end here</h3>

<p>Over the years, speculations were made that they might not have drowned. Their family itself claimed that they didn&#8217;t die but the brothers had become estranged. Even one of the siblings shared a photo taken during 1975 on his deathbed. Allegedly, John Anglin himself wrote a letter to the FBI.</p>

<p>In his letter, he had asked for medical help. He even offered to surrender if he could get the medical treatment. But, all remains a story to date. If you want to explore more about their jailbreak and aftermath, we would recommend you watch the video that reveals some great facts about the Anglin brothers.</p>
