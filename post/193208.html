<p>The love of mother and father is priceless. A parent would do anything for their child. The loving dad was determined to alleviate his child&#8217;s worries when he saw that his son was becoming self-conscious about his birthmark. He wanted to show his son how much he cared by getting him a tattoo that was identical to his birthmark.</p>
<p>“I didn&#8217;t have any hesitation,” Prue <a href="https://www.today.com/parents/dad-spends-30-hours-getting-tattoo-matches-his-son-s-t204055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says</a> about his momentous act. “My son was feeling more and more self-conscious as he was growing up, and the idea popped in my head to have the same mark as him. . . I saw it as a chance to make him feel more comfortable.”</p>
<p>Prue went to a tattoo and piercing shop near where he lives in Canada to get the job done. The dad spent over 30 hours there, getting a likeness of his son&#8217;s birthmark on his chest. Initially, he wasn&#8217;t prepared for the time it would take and the pain he would have to endure getting tattooed in such a sensitive area, but he stuck it out, knowing that it would be completely worth it.</p>
<p>Prue&#8217;s son was in disbelief when he saw his father&#8217;s identical mark as they were playing in the pool. But he was happy once he realized what his dad had done. His father&#8217;s act of solidarity gave him.<br />
He isn&#8217;t as hesitant to take his shirt off when he goes swimming now that he has the confidence to be different.</p>
<p>For his part, he wouldn&#8217;t change a thing. “Now we have the same marks for life,” he says, expressing the tender bond he created with his son.</p>
