			<p>Mercury is a rescued dog that has gained insane popularity in the Internet for his viral piano playing skills. But wait till you know his other skills and you will fall for him all over again. This beagle can also sing and is an excellent company for kids. Recently, Buddy’s owners uploaded a video, where his little daughter was dancing to what Buddy played. The video has gone viral, and definitely for a good reason. It has already crossed over 4 million views, and that’s why the internet was created.</p>
<h2>Here you can see Buddy Mercury and his little sister having a great time:</h2>
