			<p>As online sales boom, so too have the shenanigans of porch pirates.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t go a day without seeing posts in my neighborhood Facebook group reporting another package stolen off a porch by a person dressed in a hat and mask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The kind of pirate they are isn&#8217;t fun. There are no eye patches or parrots to be seen.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-187540" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/xgTgyeAHlXBfYF0tejzH.gif" alt="" width="696" height="377" /></p>
<p>They&#8217;re just another neighbor who&#8217;s perfectly friendly when you run into them on the street, but has secretly stolen your biweekly Subscribe &amp; Save delivery of toilet paper and diapers for the last three months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Laurie Pringle is a 54-year-old resident of Hamilton, Ontario.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-187541" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Woman-Leaves-Amazon-Box-Full-Of-Cat-Litter-For-Repeat-Porch-Pirate.gif" alt="" width="720" height="510" /></p>
<p>She had lost about a dozen packages to porch pirates in three years, and many of her neighbors had also.</p>
<p>Laurie left a gift for the next pirate to see her porch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>She wasn&#8217;t the only one planning. The people in her row of houses were all on board.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187542" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/D2QgBo7t9xnJZLMSOQkX.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/D2QgBo7t9xnJZLMSOQkX.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/D2QgBo7t9xnJZLMSOQkX-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The time it would take to collect enough dog poo to fill a box was an issue.</p>
<p>She had a moment when she was cleaning the litter box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Laurie dumped the entire contents of the litter box into an Amazon box.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187543" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/o60AwOa3Kk5yLpyF74SA.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/o60AwOa3Kk5yLpyF74SA.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/o60AwOa3Kk5yLpyF74SA-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>She put it on the porch with the Amazon logo visible.</p>
<p>It took 40 minutes for someone to steal it, and she <a href="https://www.facebook.com/575960635/videos/10157487365855636/">caught</a> the guy on her doorbell camera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Laurie decided to post on social media instead of reporting it to the police.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-187544" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Woman-Leaves-Amazon-Box-Full-Of-Cat-Litter-For-Repeat-Porch-Pirate_2.gif" alt="" width="710" height="592" /></p>
<p>She&#8217;s lost faith in her local police because previous attempts to report stolen packages didn&#8217;t result in much.</p>
<p>Many repeat offenders have been caught by Hamilton&#8217;s porch theft program. It&#8217;s easy for victims to simply report porch thefts to the online store and get a refund or replacement, according to a police officer.</p>
