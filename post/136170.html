			<h2>This will make you laugh and feel slightly uncomfortable at the same time.</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cats are weird and their obsession with things is even weirder. Like this time, there is a cat obsessed with bananas. We know it sounds a little funny. But more than funny, this thing is very uncomfortable to see. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name of this cutie is Bean and he has gone viral on the Internet for his unusual obsession. People are getting crazy seeing this cat with inappropriate pictures of bananas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“His vet knows about it because we’ve seen her several times this last year or so for his bouts of uveitis that he’s had a small problem with but he’s doing great and it is unrelated. She got quite a kick out of his photos. Banana would be unhealthy for a cat if consumed regularly though. So it’s definitely not a diet staple for him.”</span></p>
<h2>This is Bean, also known as “Beananas.”</h2>

<h2>“He loves following me around the house. He’s my shadow. When it snows he loves to go outside for some supervised play. He will wait by the door if I ask him ‘do you wanna be a snow bean?’ Which I will usually sing to him in tune with Frozen’s ‘Do You Want to Build a Snowman.’”</h2>
