			<p>A TikToker went viral after she refused to switch seats on a plane so that a family could all sit together.</p>
<p>Maresa Friedman has fought back against people who don&#8217;t like her and said that she is &#8220;not a villain.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a family asked her to switch seats, the passenger posted a video of herself looking pretty upset.</p>
<p>She posted this on TikTok: &#8220;No you can’t have my seat!</p>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>&#8220;I am not a villain for moving from the seat in first class I paid full fare for.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>In a series of videos after the first one, she stayed firm that families shouldn&#8217;t expect people who have already paid for their seats to move.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m also a mom, so it’s called PLANNING AHEAD,&#8221; Friedman added.</p>

<p>In the comments, many people sided with TikToker. One person wrote: &#8220;As she makes villain face, lol. Good for you, stand up for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>&#8220;I don’t give up my seat anywhere ever on a plane. I reserved it early enough to get what I wanted. Your loss if you didn’t,&#8221; someone else added.</p>
</div>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>A third person said: &#8220;Thank you! As a child free person I get shamed for not moving. I paid full price. I’m not moving.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never understand why people think you should give up the seat you paid for, just so they can sit together,&#8221; a fourth thought.</p>
</div>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<h6></h6>
<p>Another added: &#8220;This is definitely a strategy some parents are employing by not paying for seat selection, assuming the airline or ppl will move bc they have kids.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>Someone else joked: &#8220;As soon as I sit down, the noise canceling headphones go on. Any ridiculous requests will be treated as noise.&#8221;</p>

</div>
<p>Not everyone agreed with Friedman, though.</p>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>One person said: &#8220;I was on your side when I thought that u were being asked to go from 1st to economy, but it was just a row change in 1st! Most would&#8217;ve said &#8216;ok&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="css-12zje5r">
<p>Another added: &#8220;If I&#8217;m swapping my aisle for another aisle then I&#8217;m fine with swapping. I&#8217;ll totally swap.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>Friedman later said that the airline automatically books reservations together and that the family was split up because they missed a flight or a connection.</p>
