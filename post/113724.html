<p>“I think people like to believe that there is a dog interred there and there very well might be. But it’s hard to say,” Stacy Locke, Communications Manager at Green-Wood Cemetery, told My Modern Met. “It’s right under a tree and there are lots of sticks around. People will drop a stick across his little paws. Someone also left a picture of a dog there once, maybe their little pet who passed away, as to say, ‘Rex, look after my little one.&#8217;”</p>
