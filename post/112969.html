			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you like cats, you might know one thing that these furry creatures just love to do. It is observing everything. Yes, every freaking thing. These super curious cuties always want to know what&#8217;s going on. That’s why cat owners always find themselves under constant surveillance. (Well, 24/7)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you remember, there used to be a </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">glass ceiling during ancient times. Even though if no such original ceiling exists now, people have given it a new definition. And we have found one such glass ceiling just for you. (You know we love you, right?)</span></p>
