			<p>Runner Gracie Laney had a solid lead in a relay event, but it did not last for long.</p>
<p>She had no clue, that she would have a competitor who had the potential to defeat her. Not a human competitor but instead a dog who speedy and ready to join the competition.</p>

<p>Gracie Laney, had her target set to get to the finish line first. But, from on where, a fluffy dog entered the track and surprised everyone. Within a few seconds, the dog left Laney behind and not only that, but it went on to cross the finish line at the first position.</p>
<p>“I thought it was a runner at first, but then I realized that it was a dog!” Laney told The Dodo. “I for sure wasn’t ready for a dog to come through with a challenge!”</p>

<p>&#8220;I do wish I would have maybe petted him or gotten a selfie,&#8221; Laney said. &#8220;I do also love dogs, so I’m slightly sad I didn’t.&#8221;</p>
