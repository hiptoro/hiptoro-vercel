			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a sweet story of a cute Tamaskan husky pup, named Raven, and her best friend. Actually, Raven needed someone with whom she can sleep, play, eat, and enjoy. But well, you can’t pick a best friend for anyone. And Raven’s owner knew this thing very well. That’s why she took her to a shelter in Lubbock, Texas. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the shelter house, Raven met a few kittens but her little heart has only fallen in love with a fluffball named Woodhouse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I had always wanted a dog and a cat to grow up together. It’s been like a life goal,” her owner Christina added. “I wanted them to be able to get along well,” Christina explains. “So I wanted her to actually meet the cat and have the cat get along with the dog as well”. “They are perfect with each other. They don’t cuddle as much as they used to when they were a puppy and kitten. But they’re still always together, always playing together.”</span></p>
