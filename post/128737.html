			<p>If there is a problem in life, small or big, there is going to be a solution for it. You may sometimes find it early or late but you will figure it out. Here are some people who decided to find out creative ways to find solutions to their problems. Go on and take a look at these interesting ideas.</p>
<h2 id="post0" class="open-list-header">#1 I Wanted Natural Light In A Basement That Has No Windows</h2>

<p>Every idea is not brilliant, but any idea that you think is dumb in the first go, also work out interestingly. Bence Nanay Ph.D., who is a BOF Research Professor of Philosophy at the Centre for Philosophical Psychology at the University of Antwerp, for example, thinks that stupidity is part of human nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are influenced by various cognitive biases that we are not aware of,&#8221; <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/psychology-tomorrow/201806/stupidity-is-part-human-nature" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nanay wrote in <em>Psychology Today</em></a>. &#8220;The music we are listening to influences our opinion of the wine we drink, the weight of the spoon influences how creamy we find the yogurt and our moral assessment of strangers depends on what movie we have just watched. I call this paradigm of empirical findings the &#8216;We&#8217;re All Stupid&#8217; paradigm.&#8221;</p>
