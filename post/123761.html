			<p>There is so much love and purity in saving an abandoned soul. Recently, a 5-weeks-old cat named Betty was brought to Jelly’s Place animal shelter San Pablo, California. The cat came out of her shell when it became friends with the yellow lab-mix named Truvy.</p>

<h2>After being found abandoned, Betty was brought to Jelly’s Place animal shelter in San Pablo, California</h2>

<p>“I volunteer with a non-profit shelter called Jelly’s Place located in San Pablo, CA. Someone in the community had found her abandoned and brought her in. Our best guess is that she was a kitten in a feral colony,” a volunteer at the Jelly’s Place animal shelter named Kendal Benken told Hiptoro.</p>
<h2>The kitten was extremely frightened and wouldn’t let anyone touch her</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-123764 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-125.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-125.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-125-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The kitten was extremely frightened and wouldn’t let anyone touch her. “She was super scared and very hissy at first. No one could touch her,” Kendal told us. “We weren’t even sure if she was a male or female. She was only 5 weeks at the time, and most likely had never had human contact.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-123765 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-123.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-123.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-123-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>“She was not happy at all. But honestly, she was just really scared. With feral kittens, the best thing you can do for them is to put them in the center of everything and not let them hide,” Kendal explained. “So I put her in a big dog crate in my kitchen. As often as I could, I would hold her, wrapped in a towel, and pet her head.”</p>
<h2>After Betty’s foster mom took her home, rescue lab Truvy became quite fascinated with her</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-123766 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-118.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-118.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/5-118-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>“She was always licking her head when I would hold her,” Kendal told us</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-123767 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6-118.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6-118.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/6-118-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Betty was scared at first but after weeks of honest efforts, she got used Truvy as her full-fledged friend “I think because Betty was so young, she just accepted that it was normal for a giant dog to clean you. Betty absolutely loved Truvy and would curl up to sleep on her any chance she got,” Kendal told us.</p>
<h2>Throughout the next few weeks, Betty started coming out of her shell and finally accepted the doggy as her friend</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-123768 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-108.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="778" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-108.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-108-270x300.jpg 270w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>“Once Betty stopped being so afraid, she was actually a really sweet, playful kitten. It was really hard for me to give her up. I really loved her. But Roz was the perfect person for Betty! We still stay in touch. So I’ve gotten to watch Betty grow up,” the woman told us.</p>
<h2>Truvy’s love and attention transformed Betty into a loving and playful kitten who was finally ready to be adopted</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-123769 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-106.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-106.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/8-106-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>“The only thing I would like to add is that I wish more people would consider fostering, both cats and dogs. I know it’s hard giving them up. But the reward of taking in a scared animal and helping them gain the confidence to be a great dog or cat for someone else is really a wonderful thing. And fosters are desperately needed across the country by shelters and rescues,” Kendal added.</p>
