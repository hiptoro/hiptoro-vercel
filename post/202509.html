			<p>Everyone has a favorite part of a wedding. For some, it is the vows. It is the first dance for some. It is getting to sit down and eat a fancy meal. Our favorite thing? Is it possible to hear all of the speeches?</p>
<p>We can&#8217;t get enough of all the tear-jerking words at the wedding, whether it&#8217;s the maid of honor, father of the bride, best man, or whoever else wants to say a few words.</p>
<p>A best man speech brought us to tears. Sam gave it to his brother and his new wife.</p>
<p>At first, you can see that Sam is a bit nervous, as his hands are shaking, causing his speech to shake along with him. He explains to the whole wedding that he has a condition that makes him more scared than others, and that can make him a bit more scared than others.</p>
<p>“But there is one person in the world I would do this for,” he said, as the crowd cheered him on. “Jonah Waldron. Check that. There are two people in the world I would do this for Maddy and Jonah Waldron.”</p>
<p>He talked about how much she means to him and how much of a good sister she really is to him. “You have all the makings of a great sister,” he said. “Just like my sister Clara, my whole family loves you. When you are around, they light up.”</p>
<p>He said that he never got nervous around her because she gave him peace.</p>
<p>He went on to talk about him. If we weren&#8217;t crying yet, we are now.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>“Jonah, growing up as your little brother, you never looked down on me,” he began. “You lifted me up and looked out for me and you always reminded me that being different is a real strength, not a weakness.&#8221;</p>
<p>“You were, and are, patient and kind,” he went on to say. “And you love me just as I am.”</p>
<p>He continued with fun stories of him and his brother throughout the years. Sam received standing applause when he finished his speech.</p>
<p>The video received over three million views on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@scoutrueandfam?">his TikTok page</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out the entire speech below.</p>
