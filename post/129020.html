<h2>#1 Vouching For Friends &#8211; No Matter What</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129021 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-137.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1018" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-137.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/1-137-206x300.jpg 206w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Vouching for your friends no matter what, even when they’ve done something bad. Like, if my friend cheats on their partner, and they expect me to lie for them if their partner calls me and asks where they are, I’m not lying for you and your [bad] behavior.</p>
<p>If your partner knows me well enough to have my phone number and ask where you are, why would I want to participate in lying to them? Obviously, there are worse things, but it’s a no for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I chose [my own answer] because where I live that&#8217;s actually a very common quality people want in a partner, don&#8217;t ask me why. But there&#8217;s this fear that if they&#8217;re friendly to the everyday person that means they’re just bound to cheat on you,&#8221; Naya explained.</p>
<p>The singer is shocked at the attention her TikTok has received. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t make the video with any real intent behind it and that&#8217;s the beauty of TikTok—it can reach people who feel the way you feel and gives people room to get some stuff off their chest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Apparently, I&#8217;m not the only one who finds certain things toxic but also that the word toxic is definitely a matter of perception. Two completely different minds can have opposing opinions on the same thing that is toxic but I found it cool to see both ends of the spectrum. The comment section became real informative really quickly. It was awesome,&#8221; Naya concluded.</p>
<h2 id="post1" class="open-list-header">#2 Youtube Couple Pranks</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129022 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-129.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="395" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-129.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-129-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-129-438x246.jpg 438w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-129-255x144.jpg 255w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-129-350x198.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;YouTube couples who do pranks — they’re so obvious that they’re doing pranks, and they just get more and more extreme with&#8230;embarrassing each other on camera.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#3 Romanticizing Heartbreak</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129023 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-135.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="350" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-135.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/3-135-300x150.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The way that we romanticize getting our heartbroken and then forgiving and getting back together with the person who broke our heart. That dumb notion of ‘you always hurt the one you love’&#8230;If somebody cheats on you, lies to you, manipulates you, that is called emotional abuse. And there’s this media depiction that all it takes is the right grand gesture and then everything is resolved — it will never happen again, and you should forgive them. I’m not saying redemption isn’t possible because every situation is different, but that’s not romantic — that’s called work.</p>
<p>And if I have to watch one more gosh darn movie where we sympathize with the person who did the abuse, and we look to the person who was abused asking them to forgive them to suit our romantic narrative. &#8230; It is not glamorous, it is not romantic; it is abuse, and we need to stop idolizing it.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#4 Having Kids</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129024 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-134.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-134.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4-134-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Having kids. No, wait. It&#8217;s not toxic in its entirety. There is an aspect in it that is really toxic hear me out. Having children is glamorized and prioritize over very necessary pieces of actually raising children. People are not addressing their past traumas, they not addressing their stability, mentally, physically, financially. All of these things are taking a back seat to an idea of bringing children to this world and having a baby shower, and having a gender reveal, Both the children and parents are forced into this reality that they can&#8217;t recreate their favorite TV show family. Life is very real but having children are glamorized and the kids will group with not addressed traumas and repeat the cycle.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#5 Gender Norms</h2>

<h2 class="open-list-comments in-open-list comment-feature clearfix" data-post-id="2753216" data-open-list="true" data-comments-to-load="8" data-start="0">#7 The Broken Men &#8220;Can Only Be Healed&#8221; By Women Trope</h2>
</div>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129027 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/7-118.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1050" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/7-118.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/7-118-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/7-118-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The idea that broken men can only be healed through the love and labor of a woman. This perpetuates the idea that men cannot find healing or support from anybody except for women — which means that they don’t seek it from their friends, they don’t seek therapy, they don’t have connections outside of their [female] partner to support them. This obviously puts a huge burden on women to care for men, heal them, rehabilitate them. That same energy is not given to women.</p>
<p>Also, if you want an example, I recommend looking at almost any movie targeted to teenage girls that are about a ‘bad boy’ (the pure, loving ‘good girl’ who heals the wounds of the tortured ‘bad boy’ trope).&#8221;</p>
<h2>#8 Society And Social Media’s Obsession With Relationships</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129028 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8-115.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8-115.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/8-115-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;By no means am I saying that relationships are toxic, but what I am saying is that society and social media’s obsession with relationships — yeah, that’s not healthy at all. It’s as though everyone is more focused on the cute pictures, the matching outfits, and being able to say you have someone than actually accessing and considering ~who~ you have.</p>
<p>Daniel Sloss said it best&#8230;: It’s people out here trying to force things that shouldn’t be forced with one another because they would much rather have somebody than nothing at all. Like&#8230;there are real couples out there who don’t need to be together, should NOT be together, but they stay together because their cute couple pics go viral. And the obsession promotes the idea that being single is a flaw. It’s getting weird!&#8221;</p>
<h2>#9 Wine Culture</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129029 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9-110.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="840" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9-110.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/9-110-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Wine culture. Especially mom wine culture. &#8220;The reason mommy drinks.&#8221; &#8220;Mommy juice.&#8221; And look I am guilty of it too. I used to make jokes about it until I realized I actually had a problem. We&#8217;re grown, women. It&#8217;s not cool to joke about drinking every day. It&#8217;s alcoholism.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#10 The Modeling Industry</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129030 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/10-109.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="524" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/10-109.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/10-109-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The modeling industry. I’m surprised to this day, it’s still glorified. It’s such a toxic industry, people get away with so [many] atrocious things in that industry because they have power and control over your work, your body, and so many other things that you renounced when you started your career as a model.</p>
<p>Like, they don’t prepare you to be objectified, sexualized, and preyed on by predators. Played by people you trust, told that you’re not good enough, [and] expected to be of a standard that you will never attain. Jeopardizing your self-worth and mental health at their expense for them to make money off you. It’s such a problematic industry that we need to stop glamorizing it&#8230;</p>
<p>Please don’t&#8230;be something you&#8217;re not and let people (who don’t care about you) dictate what you should (or shouldn’t) be in this industry. If you start out, do you.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#11 Bloggers Morning Routine</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129031 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-104.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="560" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-104.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/11-104-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Bloggers who have the perfect morning routines with their kids and they cut up all the little lunch into a bento box with the love notes and a shaped apple with an octopus and their house is cleaned and they are dressed. The moms are dressed their hairs are brushed, they have made up. Where are you going, where are you going, and then their kids are in perfect outfits and then they go out of the door like that. No, it doesn&#8217;t work that way, that&#8217;s toxic, it&#8217;s a lie&#8221;</p>
<h2>#12 Being &#8220;Obsessed&#8221; With Your Significant Other</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129032 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-103.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1050" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-103.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-103-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12-103-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The idea that you guys need to be obsessed with each other when you’re in a relationship&#8230;Apparently, we have to text each other every day — all day long — and if we don’t text back within a reasonable amount of time, or we don’t explain why we didn’t text back, then all of a sudden that means we’re not into you anymore. If you’re not texting each other, then you’re probably on FaceTime until your phone dies or on FaceTime until you fall asleep. And some people like to be on FaceTime while they’re asleep, which is kinda weird&#8230;</p>
<p>Basically dedicating all your time to your significant other — that’s kind of unhealthy. ‘Cause, imagine you dedicated so much time and energy to a relationship that you had nothing else going on in your life. You’re gonna feel so broken if that relationship fails because you got way too attached.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#13 Beauty Standards</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129033 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/13-102.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1050" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/13-102.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/13-102-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/13-102-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Any beauty standard. It’s too much.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#14 Being &#8220;Blunt&#8221;</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129034 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14-100.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14-100.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14-100-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14-100-438x246.jpg 438w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14-100-255x144.jpg 255w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/14-100-350x198.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Y&#8217;all please because imma need y&#8217;all to listen to this one real quick. One of the biggest pet peeves of mine and it comes a lot in friendships and is the reason why a lot of my friendships have ended is that people will try to pass off being a complete a-hole as them being &#8220;blunt&#8221; and my thing is I get the whole &#8220;I like to tell how it is&#8221; type of thing BUT there&#8217;s a difference between telling people how it is and completely bringing everyone around you and I think a lot of people get that mixed up. And what really bothers me is that a lot of people won&#8217;t see the wrong in them doing this. And then they have the nerve to be surprised when no one wants to be around them. Like sis maybe if you didn&#8217;t point out all my insecurities.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#15 Impulse Shopping</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129035 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/15-99.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="428" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/15-99.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/15-99-300x183.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Impulse shopping isn&#8217;t a problem. It&#8217;s a symptom of a deeper problem.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#16 Working Two Or Three Jobs</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129036 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/16-90.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/16-90.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/16-90-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Working two or three jobs just to survive and make ends meet so you don&#8217;t even have time for your family.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#17 Mental Health Issues</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129037 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17-86.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="420" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17-86.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17-86-300x180.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Mental health issues. Having mental issues is not a little quirk of personality, no that&#8217;s not it. And it&#8217;s the same people that get upset when people don&#8217;t take their mental health seriously but when you treat it as a quirk who is gonna take it seriously. Those people that literally sit there and brag about having depression, oh yeah I haven&#8217;t cleaned my room in a week because I have depression, oh yeah I haven&#8217;t showered in like a couple of days because I have depression.

<h2>#18 Trying To Change Someone</h2>

<p>&#8220;People who think it&#8217;s a goal or make it their mission to change someone. Not only is that a waste of your both their time because in my personal opinion people don&#8217;t change they become what they were supposed to be. In some instances you can help somebody to help who they are or whatever but at the end of the day they did it themselves, honestly I don&#8217;t think you get to take that credit. You are taking their moment of self discovery or their self-love and acting like it&#8217;s your responsibility, or that you&#8217;re the reason for it. Not saying that you can make somebody happy, but at the end of the day happiness with oneself must be found by oneself. They have to to realize that they&#8217;re happy you can&#8217;t make it happen. So to think that you can change someone, their attitude, their style, whatever you can possibly to all that but it&#8217;s not gonna do as much good as you think. At the end of the day you are turning them what you want them to be instead of who they&#8217;re meant to be and that&#8217;s selfish.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#19 Presenting A &#8220;Perfect&#8221; Marriage</h2>

<p>&#8220;The perfect marriage that you think you have, that you post all over social media. You’re trying to set some kind of standard that’s impossible. Marriage is hard; it’s not always fun. It takes patience and work and compromise. And if you have issues in your marriage, you’re not broken — you’re normal. Because no one in marriage is perfect.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#20 Taking People For Granted</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129040 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/20-70.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/20-70.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/20-70-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/20-70-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/20-70-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;For me, it’s people who think that caring the least is cool and [that] it gives you an upper hand over people who care about you. That’s so toxic. If you value them and want them in your life, show up for them in your way — in the best way you can. But don’t treat people less than just because you know they care about you and they’ll be there for you. Don’t [take them for granted] because you think they’ll always be there, because one day you’ll wake up and they won’t be. And let’s care about people who care about us, and let’s show up for each other.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#21 &#8220;Being A &#8220;Ride Or Die&#8221;</h2>

<p>&#8220;Being a &#8220;ride or die.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#22 &#8220;No New Friends&#8221;</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129042 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22-47.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="394" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22-47.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22-47-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22-47-438x246.jpg 438w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22-47-255x144.jpg 255w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/22-47-350x198.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;This concept of ‘no new friends’ — we gotta cut that out. You close yourself off from meeting people who could become a better friend than the one that you have. ‘Cause that friend is probably toxic.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#23 Rude Significant Other</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-129043 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/23-45.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="413" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/23-45.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/23-45-300x177.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;When people say, &#8216;I want a significant other that is rude and mean and not friendly to anybody.&#8217; Girl, no one&#8217;s gonna cheat on you. It&#8217;s okay&#8221;</p>
