			<p>I&#8217;ve made it clear in the past that I don&#8217;t like homeowner&#8217;s associations and I&#8217;m not the only one.</p>
<p>Many of them have proven themselves to be powerful breeding grounds for power-tripping busybodies who seem hell-bent on putting their rules before even the most basic considerations for human decency.</p>
<p>When their aggressive enforcers are convinced that even the pettiest of their neighborhood&#8217;s affairs will negatively affect their property values, that gives them a relentless zeal to their concerns about the length of your lawn or how you decorate your house.</p>
<p>One man&#8217;s story of holiday humbug shows that some homeowners associations will push their rules even if they don&#8217;t apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The man we&#8217;re about to hear from lives in a neighborhood with a homeowner&#8217;s association and his house was built before it existed.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-182825" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/DALAXt5WhgRQYjcaSnfw.png" alt="" width="768" height="1027" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He explained in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/r7igkm/aita_for_putting_up_my_christmas_lights_early/">post</a> that he is exempt from both the rules of the homeowners association and the rules of the real estate attorney.</p>
<p>He said that the most recent incident he&#8217;s been through with the homeowners association serves as a perfect example of how they tend to react to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A woman told him that the Christmas lights he put up to delight his nieces and nephews violated the rules of the homeowners association.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-182826" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dot2RIX7yG9ytq24g1J1.png" alt="" width="1024" height="758" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He put them up too early for their liking and he had more up than they were willing to accept.</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;I told her that we been over this before that I am in no way beholden to their policies and don’t care.&#8221;</p>
<p>The guy liked the people in that neighborhood, but he didn&#8217;t want to follow the rules of the association he didn&#8217;t belong to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He told her that he would leave them up until Christmas.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-182827" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4C7BuafJfXc1jHNllOSb.png" alt="" width="2160" height="1187" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He mentioned that this didn&#8217;t stop the woman from trying.</p>
<p>The guy stated, &#8220;She told me that me breaking the rules upset other members and that I should respect their rules even if I don’t follow them because I technically live in the neighborhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>He threw the flyer in the trash after she told him to get off his property.</p>
<p>The guy is wondering if he should have tried to meet her halfway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Most of the commenters who read his story told him he wasn&#8217;t obliged to do that, but they strongly advised him not to.</h2>

<p>One Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/r7igkm/aita_for_putting_up_my_christmas_lights_early/hmzmcn6/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">asked</a> &#8220;What part of &#8216;I’m not a member of the HOA&#8217; does she not understand?&#8221; which led another to say, &#8220;It kills them that somebody could possibly exist that isn&#8217;t beholden to their rules.&#8221;</p>
<p>The consequences for doing so were laid out by another person.</p>
<p>As the Redditors <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/r7igkm/aita_for_putting_up_my_christmas_lights_early/hn0576i/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">say</a>, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare agree &#8220;out of respect&#8221; or for any other non-legal reason to ANY of their rules. If you do that, you may set up precedence in behavior that could potentially make you legally bound to their rules.&#8221;</p>
