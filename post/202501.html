			<p>You never know who will be sharing an airplane with you on a flight. In August of 2021, no one on the Frontier Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Miami knew that there would be crimes happening in the air.</p>
<p>Police said the man groped the breasts and backsides of two flight attendants and was later seen on video punching a male attendant who tried to restrain him.</p>
<p>The only way anyone could get him to remain seated was to use seat-belt extenders as well as duct tape to tape him to his seat for the rest of the flight. He was shouting and screaming in front of the other passengers and they taped his mouth shut to keep him quiet.</p>
<p>Berry was found guilty of three counts of assault. He was given 60 days in prison and one year of supervised release. He was told to report to prison on August 1st, one whole year after he was taken into custody at Miami International Airport.</p>
<p>“He’s a really good kid from a great family, who was punished for his worst day,” said Berry’s lawyer Jason Kreiss in a statement. “Although we don’t believe 60 days was necessary based on Max’s significant self-reform and other mitigating factors, we respect the judgment of the court.”</p>
<p>Berry was under the influence of alcohol according to multiple sources. He went to the bathroom after he spilled a drink on himself. A flight attendant helped him get a clean one out of his bag when he emerged from the restroom.</p>
<h2></h2>
<p>Berry groped the woman and punched the male as he walked through the cabin. Many passengers tried to restrain him when he became unruly.</p>
<p>Many people on board have cell phones. The passenger in the video is named Alfredo Rivera.</p>
<p>“He kept screaming and cursing—in my opinion, they [the flight attendants] did a very good job,” he said.</p>

<p>What do you think the crew did? What do you think about Berry&#8217;s sentencing? If you were a passenger on this flight, what would you do?</p>
