			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since we all love watching movies, I want to ask something- how do you describe a perfect movie? What matters to you the most in a film? Is it the destination, journey, or characters? Does the movie need to have a good ending? Well, if you are a sucker for great endings, you would not disagree with the list mentioned below. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here we have compiled a list of movies with endings so terrible, they ruined the entire movie. Like c’mon who becomes a flash drive or who can reverse the time by flying backward around the earth? These endings surely sound too weird to be true but well, they ruined the entire movie. </span></p>

Lucy. I hate that movie.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a really good concept and movie until the very. It tells the story about a girl that is kidnapped and used as a drug mule for this new drug, but the bag inside her leaks, and she gets overdosed. This doesn&#8217;t kill her though, she&#8217;s now able to use more than 10% of her brain (which I know is complete bullsh*t cuz we use 100% of our brain but not at the same time) and gets superpowers. Then for some reason, she needs to take more of the drug to reach complete usage of her brain and, when she does, she becomes a flash drive. A FLASH DRIVE. SHE BECOMES A FLASH DRIVE</p>

Ready player one</p>
<p>the guy is the gameworld every day all day long because his life sucks and that&#8217;s understandable</p>
<p>the movie ends with him getting the company, and one of the rules he implements is that the game world gets shut off 1 or 2 days every week&#8230; AFTER HE GOT A GIRLFRIEND! what an unbelievable ass that guy is, he was literally online every single day when his life was [miserable], but now that he has a girlfriend he shuts it off so people can &#8221;enjoy life&#8221; you didn&#8217;t seem to enjoy it in your abuse household earlier in the movie&#8230;</p>

Spielberg&#8217;s version of War of the Worlds, somehow Robbie is still alive and waiting for them in Boston.

Hancock. Loved the premise and seeing Hancock start as this sarcastic, alcoholic, and bitter hero who&#8217;s hated by everyone and then turn into an actual hero who people look up to and respect is touching. The PR angle for a superhero movie was interesting and unique. But then all of that is ruined by the lover&#8217;s twist. I&#8217;m fine with either the superhero PR angle or the tragic lover&#8217;s angle, but they&#8217;re way too different, and the latter is introduced too suddenly. Hancock really feels like two separate movies stitched together</p>

The Breakfast Club.</p>
<p>The premise of the whole film is, &#8220;teenagers can be judgy and awful to each other, but everyone is fighting their own battles so we should try to be nicer to each other&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they give the weird quirky girl a makeover to look more like the normal girl, people partner up in order of attractiveness and the nerdy dude is left on his own&#8230;</p>

The ending of the horror movie 1408 where he dies. The version I saw was way creepier where he lived and they were going through the box of stuff and found the tape recording he had used while in the hotel room and they heard his daughter on the tape. That was a damn good ending</p>

Click. A fantastic movie about how life can pass you by if you let it and the consequences of your actions. If they ended it in the hospital as he was dying, it would have been a fantastic, insightful movie. But no, let&#8217;s let him rewind and live happily ever after.</p>

A Simple Favor. It was all mysterious with some good twists, then she just gets hit by a car and the moms group is like, &#8216;Don’t mess with moms&#8217; or some sh*t? The ending felt like it was meant for a different movie</p>

I hate the ending of a classic 1940s film called Gentleman&#8217;s Agreement. Gregory Peck plays a journalist who pretends to be Jewish in order to write an article about antisemitism. His girlfriend knows about the ruse and as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that she&#8217;s a closet antisemite. They argue about this but in the end, he stays with her.</p>

Bridge to Terabithia broke me as a child. No one can watch that movie/read the book more than once. I went into the theater as an 8-year-old expecting a fun fantasy movie and that is not what I got.</p>

Justice League, Superman gets resurrected and immediately beats the sh*t out of Steppenwolf. The conflict was just gone, the heroes had no difficulty after he came in</p>

<p id="2922348" class="post-content-description text-open-list"><span class="bordered-description with-image">Zootopia. The teeth for all the animals had been spot on (appropriate and detailed morphology for each taxon) but the final bit where they have Flash open his mouth revealed they gave him additional and inappropriate teeth for a sloth. As a slothologist and mammalogist, this was a huge letdown and betrayal.</span></p>
