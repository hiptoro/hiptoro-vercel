			<p>When you realize you need to go to Costco, does anyone else experience the same thrill and dread? On the other hand, you have a lot of free samples to look forward to. Oh, the deals.</p>
<p>Every other human in your city is going to be there at the same time, and they will all want the free samples. It&#8217;s a nightmare every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>There are a few reasons why the shopping experience at Costco is unique.</h2>

<p>There is a hot dog and soda deal. Try to beat that. Is it good for your heart? Probably not. Is it good for you? Absolutely.</p>
<p>There are ridiculous sizes of everything. If you have to feed a family of eight, or if you have an obsession that rivals a family of eight, chances are you have a membership to the warehouse club.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The other big difference you notice is when someone checks your receipt after you leave the store.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183219" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-319.png" alt="" width="640" height="854" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-319.png 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screenshot-319-225x300.png 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>What is the deal with that? This doesn&#8217;t happen at Walmart or Target, right?</p>
<p>You would think that it would be about <a href="https://thetakeout.com/wisconsin-stole-hennessy-costco-receipt-check-video-1834641641">theft prevention</a>, but there are other people on the floor who are responsible for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The receipt checkers don&#8217;t often give your cart enough of a look to determine what should be there and what shouldn&#8217;t.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183220" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CLmgrjmXvx6GuRGF4N7R.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CLmgrjmXvx6GuRGF4N7R.jpg 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/CLmgrjmXvx6GuRGF4N7R-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>When comparing it to an arm-length receipt, what can a four-second glance tell you?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about theft prevention, but looking for cashier errors that fall into two categories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>There may be an inventory to consider, for one.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183221" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EyKsqQxLqIt6eMJDiPtn.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="853" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EyKsqQxLqIt6eMJDiPtn.jpg 480w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/EyKsqQxLqIt6eMJDiPtn-169x300.jpg 169w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>The inventory can easily be thrown off if the cashiers don&#8217;t correctly scan everything that crosses their belt because they&#8217;re trying to get those huge lines down as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Whether you&#8217;ve been overcharged or undercharged is one of the big cashier errors they&#8217;re looking for.</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Always double check your receipts! I almost threw this away when I noticed. Costco accidentally charged me $99.99 for Turkey wraps  instead of $9.99! ðŸ˜± <a href="https://t.co/YMmZrFQ0XC">pic.twitter.com/YMmZrFQ0XC</a></p>

<p>The receipt checkers could be saving you money because customers are overcharged more often than they are undercharged.</p>
<p>One of the former workers told <a href="https://consumerist.com/2012/11/16/former-costco-employee-responds-to-man-who-refuses-to-show-membership-card-or-have-receipt-checked/">Consumerist</a>, &#8220;I hardly ever saw people that had items that had not been paid for. Literally maybe once or twice in a month of working the door. We would catch hundreds of dollars a week in overcharges, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What happens when the receipt checkers look for something?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-183222" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6Kd6r270QJCT2VGzcPz9.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="640" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6Kd6r270QJCT2VGzcPz9.jpg 480w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6Kd6r270QJCT2VGzcPz9-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The exit door procedure I would usually follow was to check the receipt for multiples of the same item and make sure they were there,&#8221; the former employee said. &#8220;If they didn&#8217;t have a lot of items in the cart we would just look at the &#8216;Total number of items shown on the bottom of the receipt, count the number of items in the cart, and make sure that matched.&#8221;</p>
<p>You have it! The receipt checkers are on your side.</p>
