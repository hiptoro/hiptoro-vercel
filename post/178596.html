			<p>Dirty Dancing is one of the most popular movies of all time.</p>
<p>As many times as you have watched the film, there is still so much you don&#8217;t know. You will become the leading expert on Dirty Dancing once and for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s one of the most iconic movies of all time.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-178598" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/fXPof1Tj9nGXwbXyMJnV_1.gif" alt="" width="472" height="472" /></p>
<p>It tells a beautiful story about love and even deals with sensitive subject matter such as abortion, which was shocking for people at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Just because people loved the movie, doesn&#8217;t mean they know everything about it.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-178599" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/nmiI0N1VrIXnM8hM1zqc.gif" alt="" width="644" height="362" /></p>
<p>People don&#8217;t know a lot of interesting facts. We are here to help. Let&#8217;s learn all the interesting facts about the film.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Eleanor Bergstein said that &#8220;Dirty Dancing&#8221; sparked a political movement in other parts of the world.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178600" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jllZie7x4JYjDInDeci3.png" alt="" width="768" height="475" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jllZie7x4JYjDInDeci3.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/jllZie7x4JYjDInDeci3-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;When a woman comes in for help, it&#8217;s a policy in the battered women&#8217;s shelters in Russia. First, they wash and dress her wounds, then they give her soup.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Then they show her Dirty Dancing.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-178601" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6PpnozwE3EuLFNwLHZCR.gif" alt="" width="564" height="564" /></p>
<p>When the Berlin Wall came down, there were pictures of kids wearing t-shirts that said &#8220;We want to have what they have in the West!&#8221; She said in 2006 that they wanted Dirty Dancing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. Patrick Swayze injured himself while filming because he insisted on doing his own stunts.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178602" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6F6IoQ73qqhqqcxPEtbb.png" alt="" width="768" height="424" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6F6IoQ73qqhqqcxPEtbb.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6F6IoQ73qqhqqcxPEtbb-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>He had to have fluid drained from his knee in order to continue filming after he injured it during the famous log scene.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s commitment!</p>
<h2>When he passed away, that little bit of information was confirmed by the woman who was with him.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-178603" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rYnjqsPJEgPGpynVfl8I.gif" alt="" width="677" height="344" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Patrick was a rare combination of raw masculine and amazing grace. He was a cowboy with a tender heart.&#8221; She said that he was fearless and insisted on doing his own stunts, so it was not surprising that he waged a war on his cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Some scenes in the movie were filmed in different states, which made it appear like the entire movie was filmed in one place.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178604" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/v9O5ghz8pFNETdyRLblm.png" alt="" width="768" height="506" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/v9O5ghz8pFNETdyRLblm.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/v9O5ghz8pFNETdyRLblm-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>The cabin exteriors were filmed at Mountain Lake in Virginia, while the lake scene was filmed at Lake Lure in North Carolina.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. At the time Jennifer Grey was auditioning for the role of Baby, she was 26 years old.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178605" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LyNuVkoCG1ynm8gXOJ9m.png" alt="" width="768" height="464" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LyNuVkoCG1ynm8gXOJ9m.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/LyNuVkoCG1ynm8gXOJ9m-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>She had to prove that she was capable of pulling off a younger character.</p>
<p>She was able to win over the casting directors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. There was a theory according to Patrick on why the movie was such a classic.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178606" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NbZKdifQPzPO0npUeCjC.png" alt="" width="640" height="433" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NbZKdifQPzPO0npUeCjC.png 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NbZKdifQPzPO0npUeCjC-300x203.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;It makes a lot of sense to me,&#8221; he said it had so much heart.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not about sensuality; it&#8217;s about people trying to find themselves.</p>
<h2>He said that the young dance instructor felt like a product.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178607" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gDoOAEBF2KCNxxHOiHIt.png" alt="" width="768" height="462" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gDoOAEBF2KCNxxHOiHIt.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/gDoOAEBF2KCNxxHOiHIt-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>A young girl is trying to find out who she is in a society of restrictions when she has an amazing take on things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. Baby and Johnny are always wearing contrasting colors. This was done on purpose.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178610" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/T3FkTgPb7j7PsxvCnazQ.png" alt="" width="640" height="442" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/T3FkTgPb7j7PsxvCnazQ.png 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/T3FkTgPb7j7PsxvCnazQ-300x207.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Baby wears pale colors throughout the film, while Johnny wears darker ones.</p>
<p>This was done to portray Baby&#8217;s innocence and Johnny&#8217;s dark, brooding persona coming together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>7. The &#8220;Cry To Me&#8221; love scene was voted the sexiest movie scene of all time.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178611" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cCjtOycUyxj6tGFCsb7n.png" alt="" width="640" height="478" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cCjtOycUyxj6tGFCsb7n.png 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cCjtOycUyxj6tGFCsb7n-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Sorry to Edward and Bella. These two are good at turning up the heat.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are many other love scenes that can compete with this one, but &#8220;Cry To Me&#8221; is still the best one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>8. Two weeks before they started filming, the rehearsals began.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178636" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/G7KtfsCJd1dru3iwCcy4.png" alt="" width="640" height="414" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/G7KtfsCJd1dru3iwCcy4.png 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/G7KtfsCJd1dru3iwCcy4-300x194.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/G7KtfsCJd1dru3iwCcy4-540x350.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The cast only had two weeks of dance rehearsals before they began filming.</p>
<p>They wanted to make sure the leaves didn&#8217;t change colors halfway through filming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>9. Sarah Jessica had also tried out for the role of Baby but didn&#8217;t get it.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178637" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/wwLGdKP1zoU12OYbMYc2.png" alt="" width="768" height="460" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/wwLGdKP1zoU12OYbMYc2.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/wwLGdKP1zoU12OYbMYc2-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>Billy said that Sarah almost got the part after the film&#8217;s success.</p>
<p>The deciding factor was who had better chemistry with Patrick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>10. Patrick refused to be a part of the sequel because he was against it.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178638" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lgw3igjf8Y2kNxqnglBb.png" alt="" width="640" height="416" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lgw3igjf8Y2kNxqnglBb.png 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lgw3igjf8Y2kNxqnglBb-300x195.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lgw3igjf8Y2kNxqnglBb-540x350.png 540w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>He turned down $6 million to reprise the role of Johnny because he was against sequels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>11. The movie was supposed to have some nude scenes originally.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178639" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/J3WNY9a8ncL9ZyHUVkNb.png" alt="" width="768" height="476" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/J3WNY9a8ncL9ZyHUVkNb.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/J3WNY9a8ncL9ZyHUVkNb-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>There were nude scenes in the director&#8217;s cut of the film.</p>
<p>The scenes were cut from the final version of the movie after viewers voted against it during screen testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>12. Patrick Swayze was the only actor who was considered to play Johnny.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178640" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rPinadE3wGpjyfJTITxE.png" alt="" width="640" height="451" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rPinadE3wGpjyfJTITxE.png 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/rPinadE3wGpjyfJTITxE-300x211.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Only Patrick was considered for Johnny. It was only him. We looked through pictures and I said, ‘Oh, there’s the eyes we want,’ and we turned them over, and Emile [Ardolino], our director, said, ‘As a matter of fact he’s a Joffrey dancer,'&#8221; screenwriter, Eleanor Bergstein revealed.</p>
<h2>She added, &#8220;We followed him and when I met him I said, &#8216;Now I know you and if you decide not to do it, I find it hard to believe I will make this movie…&#8221;</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178642" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/reeZr52dFHwwLZYB8lkJ.png" alt="" width="640" height="441" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/reeZr52dFHwwLZYB8lkJ.png 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/reeZr52dFHwwLZYB8lkJ-300x207.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;It was always Patrick, the only one we offered it to, and a wonderful, brilliant, good man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>13. Grey said that Swayze was more fearless than her.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178646" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/etNwSb0lfalMdoBvGhqQ.gif" alt="" width="480" height="270" /></p>
<p>The chemistry between the two of them was served by that.</p>
<p>She said that she and her husband were like a marriage where you have two opposites. &#8220;I would be scared to do anything if he did anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>14. Grey and Swayze ended up getting along even though they fought a lot.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178647" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/OTguHV42r2K0sX0yVMt8.png" alt="" width="1280" height="699" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/OTguHV42r2K0sX0yVMt8.png 1280w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/OTguHV42r2K0sX0yVMt8-300x164.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/OTguHV42r2K0sX0yVMt8-1024x559.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/OTguHV42r2K0sX0yVMt8-768x419.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/OTguHV42r2K0sX0yVMt8-730x400.png 730w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Grey said there was a feeling of an easy chair. She mentioned the words he said to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will never let you get hurt. Could throw myself around. I might be careless with my own body, but I will stand in front of a train for you.&#8221;</p>
<h2>She said that she was doing things that she had never been capable of doing before, because of her ability to allow him to take care of her.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-178648" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IICE0mrFZKfvsPpfhRHS.gif" alt="" width="608" height="370" /></p>
<p>That was life imitating art.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have tears in my eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>15. Eleanor Bergstein didn&#8217;t think the movie would become famous.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-178650" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xiUP8Q2OERCrNYWq822v.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="900" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xiUP8Q2OERCrNYWq822v.jpg 1600w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xiUP8Q2OERCrNYWq822v-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xiUP8Q2OERCrNYWq822v-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xiUP8Q2OERCrNYWq822v-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xiUP8Q2OERCrNYWq822v-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xiUP8Q2OERCrNYWq822v-438x246.jpg 438w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xiUP8Q2OERCrNYWq822v-255x144.jpg 255w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/xiUP8Q2OERCrNYWq822v-350x198.jpg 350w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;We had no hope of anything. The studio producers told us that the movie would go straight to video bins after a few days in the theater. After all these years, it was our wonderful audiences who kept it in the theater.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
