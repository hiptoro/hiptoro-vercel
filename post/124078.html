			<p>Satan surrounds with a pre-built evil reputation. Whenever someone takes out the word Satan from their mouth, it is obvious, that an eyebrow or two would be raised. Satanists&#8217; beliefs and ideologies are based around the notion of the devil but it does not necessarily mean that they engage in any evil activity. The non-theistic religious group called The Satanic Temple has branches all over the world. The supporters only wish and work towards the wellbeing of the community members.</p>
<p>The myth about the community of Satanists is that they perform violent rituals but that isn&#8217;t what you will learn about them today. We have a few examples for you which are going to prove that they can come forward to support the homeless and people who are victims of domestic abuse.</p>
