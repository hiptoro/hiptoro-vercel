<p>Meirivone Rocha Moraes and Ragdoll Marcelo were going to celebrate their one-year anniversary, but she was heartbroken when a friend saw him sneaking into a motel with another woman.</p>
<p>And now they sleep in different rooms.</p>

<p>Devastated Meirivone said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I found out through a friend who told me that she saw Marcelo entering a motel with another woman while I was hospitalised for three nights and three days with Marcelinho, our son, who had a virus.</p>
<p>At first, I thought she was lying, but then I started looking through his phone and I saw the conversations, which made me sure he was cheating. He kept denying everything and said he loves me very much, as well as asking for forgiveness and crying a lot.</p>
<p>The argument was ugly and scared [our son] who was crying, so I shouted to him: &#8216;Do you see what you&#8217;ve done?&#8217; I asked him who the woman was and he didn&#8217;t respond.</p></blockquote>

<p>She thought about kicking cheating Marcelo out of the house at first, but for the sake of her children, Carol and Diego, and their &#8220;baby&#8221; Marcelo, she agreed to let him stay.</p>

<p>She added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I wanted to put him out of the house but our baby is growing up and at this stage, he would miss his father a lot. Also, the love I feel for him made me forgive – not completely – but I don&#8217;t think I could live without my husband.</p>
<p>I need to talk with him, so he can decide once and for all that he doesn&#8217;t cheat anymore and if he does one more time, I won&#8217;t forgive him.</p></blockquote>
