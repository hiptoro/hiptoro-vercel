			<p>Concerns were raised when Britney Spears posted a video of her putting her face in a cake on Instagram during her birthday week earlier this month.</p>
<p>In the music video, the singer, who just turned 41 on December 2, wore a jumpsuit with Christmas patterns and a bright red color.</p>
<p>She can be seen dancing on the floor, gyrating, doing her signature hair flip dance move, and giving the haters the middle finger in the short video clip. She also looks like she is drinking something that might be champagne. At the very end of the video, she puts her face in a piece of birthday cake and then rubs icing down her front while striking a pose for the camera.</p>
<p>The song &#8220;Santa Baby&#8221; by Eartha Kitt can be heard playing in the background of the video, which has since been taken down from all of Spears&#8217; social media accounts. During the same week that she had her birthday, her Instagram account was shut down. She says she did it by accident by pressing &#8220;the wrong button,&#8221; as a source explained.</p>

<p>After watching the video, a number of loyal fans went to different social media sites and posted messages like the one below:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gotta admit this video did kinda creep me out.</p></blockquote>

<p>Even though not everyone thought the video was strange, many people on the internet said that when Spears&#8217; 13-year conservatorship is over in 2021, she will be free to live her life however she wants and no longer have to follow the rules of the conservatorship.</p>
<blockquote><p>She owes the world nothing. She doesn&#8217;t have to &#8216;give&#8217; anyone anything, regardless of her talents. She&#8217;s given enough. She can live however she wants now,</p></blockquote>

<p>Britney Spears&#8217; conservatorship ended last year. Since then, the pop star&#8217;s strange behavior has been in the spotlight on Instagram and other social media sites.</p>
<p>In 2008, her father, Jamie, and her lawyer, Andrew Wallett, were made her legal guardians because people were worried about her mental health. Because of this, they now have a lot of control over her life, including her money, career, and big personal decisions.</p>
<p>Spears was given a guardian, and because of that, her ability to remarry and even her rights to see her two sons were managed and controlled.</p>
<p>In June 2021, five months before her guardianship was supposed to end by law, she gave the following statement to a court through the BBC:</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to be able to get married and have a baby. I was told right now in the conservatorship I am not able to get married and have a baby.</p></blockquote>
<p>The singer best known for her hit &#8220;Toxic&#8221; went on to say that she wasn&#8217;t allowed to take out her intrauterine device (IUD), which kept her and her long-term partner Sam Asghari from starting a family.</p>
<p>After her time under conservatorship was over, Spears has been honest about her problems and has been using social media regularly to encourage others and promote a more positive attitude.</p>
