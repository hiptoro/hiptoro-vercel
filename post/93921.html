			<p>An adorable girl with Down&#8217;s Syndrome is flooding the internet with her cute pictures. She is just 4 years old and dreams of becoming a model.</p>
<p>Michelle, mother of the girl said &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Francesca has been modeling since she was very young. She loves it and was the first toddler in Malta to take part in a modeling competition and won the junior top model.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In an interview, Michelle shared that her daughter loves doing modeling. Francesca is &#8220;very comfortable on the catwalk&#8221;, so much so that when she appeared alongside Madeline in November 2019, it was her 50th time on the runway!</p>
<p>Francesca Rausi wins thousands of hearts in November last year. After her stuff on the runway during a fashion show for disabled models in Malta.</p>

<p>The world’s first international model with Down Syndrome &#8211; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madelinesmodelling_/?hl=en">Madeline</a> has changed the outlook of the modeling industry.  In 2017, <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/kylie-jenner-makes-forbes-list-of-americas-wealthiest-celebrities/">Forbes</a> named Madeline number one for Diversity in the Fashion Industry. It is because of her willingness to challenge traditional beauty standards, she has reached so far.</p>
<p>Michelle added expressing &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Michelle, believes that she&#8217;s more than capable of the job too. I feel very emotional watching her because I see the happiness in her eyes. It&#8217;s out of this world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Charity organizer Tiziana told to a spokesperson &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p> &#8220;Our goal is to create a real inclusion, trying to involve all the different disabilities by breaking down the mental barriers of those who see disability as a limit. Instead, we see it and live as a resource and a wealth to share.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Tiziana Randisi has established the Malta fashion show in 2018. To create awareness and wanted inclusion between people with different disabilities. Her last year&#8217;s show featured 22 incredible models under category from four to 24 years old.</p>
