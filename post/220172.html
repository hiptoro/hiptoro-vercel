			<p>Henry Cavill was just fired from his role as Superman, but if screenwriter C. Robert Cargill has his way, Superman might get a whole new role.</p>
<p>Cavill was going to put on his red cape again, but not long ago, the actor said that the plans would not go through.</p>
<p>Henry Cavill wrote in an Instagram post:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have just had a meeting with <a href="https://www.unilad.com/film-and-tv/james-gunn-reveals-why-henry-cavill-is-no-longer-returning-as-superman-624479-20221215">James Gunn</a> and Peter Safran and it&#8217;s sad news, everyone. I will, after all, not be returning as Superman.</p>
<p>After being told by the studio to announce my return back in October, prior to their hire, this news isn&#8217;t the easiest, but that&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>The changing of the guard is something that happens. I respect that.</p>
<p>James and Peter have a universe to build. I wish them and all involved with the new universe the best of luck, and the happiest of fortunes.</p>
<p>For those who have been by my side through the years&#8230;we can mourn for a bit, but then we must remember&#8230;. Superman is still around.</p>
<p>Everything he stands for still exists, and the examples he sets for us are still there!</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>My turn to wear the cape has passed, but what Superman stands for never will. It&#8217;s been a fun ride with you all, onwards and upwards.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it looks like C. Robert Cargill, who wrote Sinister and Doctor Strange, might be willing to help Cavill find a new role.</p>
<p>Rahul Kohli, who has been in shows like iZombie and Midnight Mass on Netflix, tweeted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Henry, f**k it, let’s make a Warhammer movie/limited series. Kind regards, Rahul.</p></blockquote>
<p>To which Cargill replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Look, guys. I might know a writer who would be into that. Maybe y&#8217;all should brainstorm in his garage. Best, Cargill.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kohli&#8217;s tweet has gotten more than 33,000 &#8220;likes&#8221; since it was posted a few hours ago, which shows that fans are interested.</p>

<p>Someone replied to the post by writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey Henry, Yes, yes you should very much take up Rahul&#8217;s offer and do this. Very much so!</p></blockquote>
<p>Another said,</p>
<blockquote><p>As a writer of Warhammer stuff, I approve this suggestion wholeheartedly.</p></blockquote>
<p>A third person said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh god yes please. Someday in a distant future we’ll actually get a live action Warhammer movie.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warhammer would be a good fit for the actor, who has said before that he loves the miniature wargame, so this could be something to keep an eye on.</p>
