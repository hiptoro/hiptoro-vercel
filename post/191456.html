<p><a href="https://datatopics.worldbank.org/what-a-waste/trends_in_solid_waste_management.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to The World Bank</a>, the world generates a whopping 2.01 billion tons of municipal solid waste each year. Around a third of that isn’t dealt with in an environmentally safe manner. High-income countries might account for 16 percent of the global population, but they generate 34 percent of the total waste.</p>
<p>Globally, each person creates anywhere from 0.11 to 4.54 kilograms of waste each day, depending on where they live. The situation is bound to get worse as the world’s population increases and more nations become developed. By the year 2050, the amount of global waste is set to grow to 3.40 billion tonnes.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems contributing to climate change and pollution is the massive production of single-use plastics and packaging. If products were built to be used and reused, we’d be in a far better position to deal with the climate crisis.</p>
<p>Greenpeace explained to Bored Panda that it’s mainly corporations that bear the biggest responsibility for changing how plastic is used and produced globally. The role of individuals is still important, however, it’s important not to lose sight of the big picture and where the biggest impact could be made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Though it’s important for individuals to take part in the reuse revolution movement and do their best to reduce their plastic footprints, the responsibility lies on the multinationals that produce single-use plastic packaging in the first place,&#8221; a Greenpeace representative told Bored Panda.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the big challenges we are faced with is the corporation&#8217;s addiction to single-use plastic and their relationship with the fossil fuel industry. As global demand for oil declines, the fossil fuel industry is doubling down on plastic, the new frontier for petrochemical production.”</p>

<p>Greenpeace claims that big corporations are working hand-in-hand with the fossil fuel industry while putting up an eco-friendly front.</p>
<p>“While big brands like Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and Pepsi claim they are addressing the plastic pollution crisis, they are working hand-in-hand with the fossil fuel industry and making even more plastic,” the rep said.</p>
<p>“As it stands, plastic production could double within the next 10-15 years, and triple by 2050. This is alarming, especially if we are to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees. Plastic is an important part of moving away from fossil fuels, combating climate change, and protecting communities.&#8221;</p>
