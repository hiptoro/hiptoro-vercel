			<p>We all encounter several things for the first time. Those things drive us crazy and leave us with a lesson for the future. People, several times realize these random things when they are today years old. And, without any shame, they ought to share these with others.</p>
<p>Most of us have an inquisitive nature that forces us to explore new things around us. And people come across some facts that blow our minds. You would have probably heard of the phrase, &#8216;I was today years old&#8217;. It is often used as slang in many of the jokes. And such jokes are quite interesting.  These jokes have especially surged amidst coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>Currently, all of us have a lot of time free at home. And we struggle to kill our time after our study and work from home hours. Thus, we have curated all such semi-useless but fun facts below. The people explored these facts when they were today years old.</p>
