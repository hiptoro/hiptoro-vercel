			<p>Did you know that some banks charge a fee for not maintaining the minimum balance in a customer account? This is a bit absurd for sure, but trust it, it is just the beginning of how things turn out to be weird.</p>
<p>Recently, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Paratrooperkid/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Paratrooperkid</a> made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r6i36n/need_help_driving_the_point_home_please_share/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a post</a> on r/AntiWork, asking people to share their thoughts and experiences on why poor people have to bear more expenses than the rich. And they definitely picked the right place for it.</p>
<p>r/AntiWork is a subreddit with 1.3 million members who, according to the community itself, &#8220;want to end work, are curious about ending work, want to get the most out of a work-free life, want more information on anti-work ideas, and want personal help with their own jobs/work-related struggles.&#8221; In other words, these people have many things in common including thoughts on unemployment.</p>
<p>As more and more people joined to shared their answers, the post went viral. It has close to 60K upvotes and 16K comments. Here are some of the top picks for the post, scroll down to check them out.</p>

Here&#8217;s a good example of something that happens all the time. Daily. Single mom hasn&#8217;t gotten her child support check on time. A water* utility bill hits her account that was supposed to be covered by that support. Bank account goes -$135.00 due to the utility bill. The overdraft then incurs a $45 overdraft fee. So. The mom is now -$180 and the electric company sends a letter saying her power will be shut off if payment is not rendered by x date. She knows she won&#8217;t be paid until two days after the cutoff. So. Waiting for support and her check she&#8217;s now scouring her floorboard for change to put in her tank to get herself to work and the kids to school. The electric cutoff day comes and goes and the support check doesn&#8217;t show up. Because she&#8217;s being paid a sh*t wage she has nothing left over for this emergency. The electric gets cutoff and now her $135.00 bill has incurred a $50 service restart fee. Now her electric bill is $185.00 and she still owes $175 to the bank for the water* overdraft. She is still waiting on the support check. But now because she had to pay the extras for the overdraft, and the electric, she can&#8217;t afford lunch for the kids this week. So she again scours change to get a loaf of bread and peanut butter. Her kids are still hungry so they get lunch from the school. If the school isn&#8217;t a*sholes they&#8217;ll have an account for her kids that will now also be negative. This actually happened in my friends household. It was the most heartbreaking bullsh*t thing you&#8217;d ever hear. And it happens every.single.minute.</figcaption></figure>

My weekly grocery trip took almost four hours. Between the time spent looking over fliers and making a list of what I could afford, walking to the closest bus stop, transferring to another bus, an hour of shopping and tallying up my total to make sure I was within budget, waiting up to 20 minutes for a bus home, including another transfer and the walk home with all my groceries from the bus stop. I would often go without groceries because I didn’t have time to get to the store and was stuck making Kraft Dinner Mac and Cheese without butter or milk, because that is what was in the pantry. Now that I live more comfortably, I drive to the store in 10 minutes, spend 30 minutes shopping and am home and finished within an hour. ETA: it’s been more than 10 years since I ate Sad KD and today I’m lucky to have a full cupboard, fridge and freezer. I am so sorry for everybody who can recognize themselves in this post. I never realized this was such a universal experience.</figcaption></figure>

Since you&#8217;re poor, you cannot afford to live close to work and thus have a longer commute. But you also cannot afford to own and run a reliable car, so you have a beater that breaks all the time and gets poor mileage. When it breaks, you can&#8217;t get paid because you aren&#8217;t at work so you have a new bill PLUS halted income. To compensate, you take out high interest loans to repair the car. But it breaks again later so you&#8217;re always in debt for high interest loans on top of the car costs. I see this a lot in the northeast.</figcaption></figure>

I worked with homeless folks in LA for a few years. The stories I could tell you. One that was a recurring tale, all too common, were parking tickets. Rich people? Big deal. Pay it online, it’s an afterthought at its worst. Now that same parking ticket issued to a homeless person living out of their car, trying to scrounge together money for a deposit on a place whilst working a sh*tty service sector job? That’s devastating. It’s another 2-3 months of sleeping in the car. Or maybe it’s a few days worth of missed meals. Or maybe it’s skipping out on that expensive medication that your sh*tty insurance wont cover. I could provide you endless examples of the way this country punishes the poor. People need a reality check.</figcaption></figure>
