			<p>Celebrities in Hollywood face many physical obstacles and demands throughout their careers. Sometimes having talent alone is insufficient because an actor must have a particular appearance to fit particular roles. In fact, one of the hardest things an actor has to go through is probably undergoing significant physical changes for a role. Numerous celebrities have subtly altered their physical appearance throughout Hollywood history in order to perfectly embody their characters.</p>
<p>They drastically alter every aspect of who they are to fit the part. Sometimes it goes beyond just needing a wig and makeup; other times it compromises their health. It implies that they must either put on 60 pounds of muscle quickly or shed 40 pounds quickly. It&#8217;s so bizarre!</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to pay tribute to those well-known actors who made significant emotional and physical sacrifices in order to portray their characters as truthfully and accurately as they could. Here are 11 instances in Hollywood where actors underwent the most dramatic physical changes for roles, from Tom Hanks to Mark Wahlberg. To see and learn more about the modifications these stars underwent for their craft, scroll down!</p>

<h2 class="cus-heading-3">Charlize Theron, ‘Monster’</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211362" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-1.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="466" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-1.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-1-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Charlize Theron underwent a complete transformation to play real-life serial killer Aileen Wuornos in the movie. Theron changed her diet to add more than 13kg to her weight. The actress claimed that the process of changing involved more than just gaining weight; it also involved letting go of her usual strict routine in order to look the part. Given that Theron won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her efforts, it was obviously well-deserved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="cus-heading-3">Tom Hardy, ‘Bronson’</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211361" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-2.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Hardy portrays Michael Gordon Peterson, a prisoner who is regarded as Britain&#8217;s most violent offender, in the film &#8220;Bronson.&#8221; He is referred to as Charles Bronson because of his skill in bare-knuckle combat. Hardy is completely bald and sporting his signature mustache in this photo. For many actors, this role could be viewed as career-defining. Tom Hardy, however, will be able to add this achievement to his long list of successes. Hardy attempted to mimic the appearance of a &#8220;brawny bare-knuckle brawler&#8221; in order to play Charles Bronson convincingly. The real Bronson, who had spent the majority of his adult life in prison, was interviewed by Hardy when he visited a prison. Hardy bulked up for the role by gaining nearly 40 pounds in just five weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="cus-heading-3">Jake Gyllenhaal, ‘Southpaw’</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211360" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-3.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-3.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-3-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>For his part as a middleweight boxer in &#8220;Southpaw,&#8221; Jake Gyllenhaal added about 7 kg of muscle. The actor spent six months working out in Floyd Mayweather&#8217;s gym in Las Vegas, six hours a day, to get ready for the movie. When discussing how he changed for the movie, Gyllenhaal said: “The amount of time you have to put into it, the sacrifice that you put into your body, it’s not something that you’re eager to do again. It’s a huge commitment.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="cus-heading-3">Natalie Portman, ‘Black Swan’</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211359" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-4.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-4.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>For her role as a perfectionist ballerina in &#8220;Black Swan,&#8221; Natalie Portman lost about 10 kg.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="cus-heading-3">Christian Bale, ‘The Machinist’</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211358" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-5.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="473" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-5.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/11-Actors-Who-Made-The-Biggest-Body-Transformations-For-Roles-5-300x203.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
