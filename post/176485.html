<p>&#8220;At a huge pizza chain restaurant that remains widely popular, we had these perforated pans for thin crust and stuffed crust pizzas. They&#8217;d get washed in the dishwasher by the hundreds per day, and at least half would still have burnt cheese and shit on them. Well, they were just stacked to dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;When making new pizzas in those pans, sometimes the pans that were left to &#8216;dry&#8217; overnight grew bits of mold around the burnt cheese. We were told just to put the dough on top because otherwise, we&#8217;d never keep up with the orders if we rewashed everything. The manager said, &#8216;don&#8217;t worry, it gets cooked.'&#8221; — 69fatboy420</p>
<p>I always knew that takeaways weren&#8217;t clean, but I just kind of put that to the back of my mind. However, reading it and thinking about it makes me question every takeaway pizza that I have ever eaten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not currently my profession but ghostwriters in fiction. John Grisham, Danielle Steele, James Patterson, Janet Evanovich, etc., all those big names with an NYT bestseller every year, use ghostwriters who are never credited or mentioned.

<p>&#8220;I have worked in vetmed since 2013. I have this habit, especially when owners don&#8217;t want to be present for their pet&#8217;s euthanasia, in which I give their pets chocolate, pieces of my meal (meat, bread, cheese, even onions/garlic), or the best wet food from our pantry before them being given the drugs that help them pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t suffer from the damaging effects of those foods if they&#8217;re being euthanized minutes after. I like to give them a taste of something they would never get to try otherwise. Of course, I would never do this unless the pet was already en route to the room where the procedure would take place.&#8221; — RodentRescue</p>
<p>This one is painfully beautiful. I also never understood how people could leave their pets alone to be put down, it&#8217;s your responsibility, and you should comfort them in their last moments. And, way to go, I just bummed myself out. Let&#8217;s move on to a funnier one!</p>

<p>&#8220;Many hotels often sell rooms multiple times. They are used to working in an airport hotel. Knowing that some guests won&#8217;t arrive due to missed or delayed flights, we sell more rooms than we have.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have guests checking out from 2/3 am due to early flights, so even though the room is technically still theirs, you quickly and sometimes poorly clean the room and tell the unexpected arriving guest or new booking there&#8217;s a random computer issue and to wait 20 mins and then check them into the departed guest&#8217;s room praying. Multiple times I&#8217;ve had to run a kettle under a cold tap to hide the fact the previous guest used it 15 mins before the new guest arrives.&#8221; — AndromedaFire</p>
<p>And that is why I always check the kettle&#8217;s temperature when I first get into a room! I can&#8217;t settle until I&#8217;ve done this!</p>

<p>&#8220;I work for a hotel doing conferences and significant events such as weddings. I would advise people NEVER to have a host bar, i.e., all the drinks for the evening go on one tab. For example, the company owner may pay for all the drinks, or the family of the bride or groom may pay for all the drinks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is common practice for my bosses to come along and press random buttons on the till to rack up the bill without actually serving any guests. If I catch them doing it, I&#8217;ll immediately get rid of them as it&#8217;s not right. They don&#8217;t get any extra pay if we sell more at the bar, so the only reason they do it is to be like look at me to their boss.&#8221; — hastily_named</p>
<p>I wish I could use this excuse for having spent too much money on alcohol on nights out, but the truth is that I always end up buying too many damn drinks.</p>

When we get licensed to be a customs broker, we are trained and tested on knowledge and ethics.

<p>&#8220;Customs can&#8217;t screen everything coming in. I&#8217;m oversimplifying, but CBP works on the honor system. You file an entry saying what the shipment is, and they take your word for it and release it. This happens hundreds of thousands of times a day. Maybe at best customs can screen 3-7% of what&#8217;s coming in, the rest of just waived through&#8230;&#8221; — callmeraylo</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a problem in substance abuse treatment in the United States called body brokering. Substance abuse treatment can be costly, and insurance companies pay A LOT of money for a patient to be there. Treatment centers will hire &#8220;body brokers&#8221; to find addicts with the best, highest-paying insurance and entice them to check in to the specific center. The treatment center then gives the broker a commission from the insurance money.</p>
<p>&#8220;This can go as far as body brokers putting more drugs into the hands of some addicts before they come in bc the higher level of drugs in your system upon admit, the more and longer the insurance company will pay to the treatment center.</p>
