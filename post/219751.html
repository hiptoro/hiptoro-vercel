			<p>A source reported on Friday that a store worker in Minnesota gave her retro Jordans to a man who was wearing boxes on his feet.</p>
<p>Ace, which is what people call Ta Leia Thomas, works in a liquor store in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, which is a suburb of Minneapolis. Tom Agnes, the manager of Brooklyn Center Liquor, said that when he got back from lunch on Tuesday, he saw Ace working in her socks.</p>
<p>The source says that a security camera caught a man digging through a trash can outside the store to find boxes that he could wear on his feet instead of shoes. Thomas saw the man and stopped him. She gave him her favorite pair of old Air Jordans, which were her own shoes.</p>
<p>Thomas said that as soon as she saw the man, she took her shoes off.</p>
<blockquote><p>He said nobody would ever give me shoes like that and I said, &#8216;well I&#8217;m not everybody,</p></blockquote>
<p>she said.</p>
<p>Thomas said that she had &#8220;always been taught to help others&#8221; because</p>
<blockquote><p>you never know what their problem is, or what they are going through.</p></blockquote>
<p>Agnes gave Thomas a new pair of shoes at the end of the workday and wrote about it on Facebook. Since then, nearly a thousand people have commented on the post.</p>
<blockquote><p>This was not just a regular old pair of shoes. Ace, being a Minnesota Vikings fan, had on her favorite pair of purple Nike Air Jordans which she gave to the man with zero hesitation,</p></blockquote>
<p>said Agnes in a post.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a true example of empathy, compassion, and holiday cheer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Agnes said that he had raised $450 to buy Thomas a new pair of shoes as a replacement. Later, he found out that Thomas is taking care of her mother, who needs a new bed, and that Thomas was going to buy the bed for her mother. Agnes said that he gave the cash to Thomas instead, so she could buy a bed with it.</p>
<blockquote><p>I wish I could have a dozen Aces on staff,</p></blockquote>
<p>said Agnes.</p>
