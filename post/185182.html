			<p>Can you imagine someone surviving without a heart? No, right? But there is a person who is actually &#8220;heartless&#8221;. All thanks to modern medicine that has provided us with everything. It includes everything from new vaccines to protect us from deadly diseases to groundbreaking cancer treatments.</p>

<p>The story goes back to 2011 when doctors showed a machine that could allow a human to live without a heart, one of the body’s most important organs.</p>
<p>After unveiling the machine, multiple surgeons did trial and error to create a machine that wouldn’t break down or cause blood clots and infections. Fortunately, two doctors at the Texas Heart Institute have successfully developed a device that used whirling rotors to pump blood around the body without a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Dr. Billy Cohn and Dr. Buz Frazier first tested the idea in an eight-month-old calf called Abigail, removing her heart and successfully replacing it with two centrifugal pumps, which circulated the blood through her.</p>
<p>&#8220;By every metric, we have to analyze patients, she&#8217;s not living,&#8221; Cohn told NPR.</p>
<p>&#8220;But here you can see she&#8217;s a vigorous, happy, playful calf licking my hand.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgQXlEPVA_XD23uhhF-sRV64FrxA7fQGe5cH0s6UsZLQt5ujT8RWwFubTAMcQgvqWqy78986QZAxRIVw4IUXIi8TdL8HX6cDyRpBCOOrKNa-r3d9duPooLsW_rB1o0cNuzRpHrzqaTH7mpt8zxiws2gmSkoL90qeKrbOG5X4C9LXjKJBJA8M8u4HM19Cw" /></p>
<p>a 55-year-old man called Craig Lewis, who was suffering from amyloidosis, a rare autoimmune disease that causes a build-up of abnormal proteins and, in turn, rapid heart, kidney, and liver failure.</p>
<p>Lewis’ heart had become so damaged that doctors gave him about 12 hours to live, at which point his wife Linda suggested something drastic.</p>
<p>His wife Linda said: &#8220;He wanted to live, and we didn&#8217;t want to lose him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never know how much time you have, but it was worth it.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhLl7g3teeE0UJuKE_fJ5c15OrtawwtDTZqh9-mahbr8c55FHhaeO1KTi0wN_gIsH0RhwaU8DHSO-MK2H-xvwZFS5wATrpdtxIKCo-XtQwzOa0PV4j4VNTRN3mlkcmAWoIGb7PNHBkAhixEO10JOEKebbp7C3iIllt0t3MGZ8jLRti0SBRjMX2qnnV2hA" /></p>
<p>She then approached Cohn and Frazier, who removed her husband’s heart and installed the artificial device.</p>
<p>Linda said: &#8220;I listened and it was a hum, which is amazing. He didn&#8217;t have a pulse.&#8221;</p>
<p>She said her husband – who worked for the city of Houston, maintaining the city’s vast system of wastewater pumps – would have appreciated the pulseless heart cobbled together from various materials, with Cohn explaining: &#8220;Dacron on the inside and fiberglass impregnated in silicone on the outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a moderate amount of homemade stuff on here.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhIBTHJxFWHtc9HSB91en5Ev5tvO0QMQxi9f5eMmdwdtfAZ_-AyO4ln39OOkPJqpJPb52VDq8gvUmJDuw8Pz17xPv-8s9RPSNVTeEOKEQyxyX2e_MEp-RByhYW4SmmZ5ngA4tazF9qqmUe4J_cIN2xWnn78WaLT5cIAd4W-sWyZHMCTKHuwa7_fwL8eVw" /></p>
<p>&#8220;We look at all the animals, insects, fish, reptiles and certainly all mammals, and see a pulsatile circulation,&#8221; Cohn added.</p>
<p>And so all the early research and all the early efforts were directed at making pulsatile pumps.&#8221;</p>
<p>The only reason blood has to be pumped rhythmically instead of continuously is down to the heart tissue.</p>
<p>Cohn continued: &#8220;The pulsatility of the flow is essential for the heart because it can only get nourishment in between heartbeats.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiXimxDlpKbPdOoszf44_2vQ2JrdNN22-sG_UjHdD0CiVyc4YhcLSLUB_XgugG__Z4X_-v_lFjOXY3PhXcR3dpihSqMj8t71gUxePkNlFxAVVICxF0Zavj0p64mdzsS25UcBDuWx1medVqjX5w7U9KBwmp2VcMXNDOibQ8FWMpKhka_J4YxHa-VOMZyMA" /></p>
<p>&#8220;If you remove that from the system, none of the other organs seem to care much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After the procedure, Lewis woke up and began to recover – now able to speak and sit up in a chair.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;However, his condition then began to deteriorate as the disease attacked his liver and kidneys, and he sadly passed away in April that year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he did manage to live for more than a month with the pulseless heart, with his doctors saying the pumps had worked flawlessly.&#8221;</p>
