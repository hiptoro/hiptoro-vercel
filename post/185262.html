			<p>Recently, a TikTok user visited a Subway store to get a sandwich. She got a bit more than what she had asked. While preparing her sandwich, the Subway staff member dozed off on the job. The customer managed to record the incident and to understand the seriousness of the matter, she took it to her social media, where it sparked a debate between netizens and other audiences. The netizens show concern for the Subway worker in the video who looks exhausted.

<p>The TikTok user @ss4xgoku1 wrote while sharing the video on social media platform: &#8220;Like [for real]&#8230; I just wanted a Sandwich bro.&#8221; The video shows the poor Subway worker sprinkling some ingredients on top of a haphazard arrangement of sandwich toppings before she gradually falls asleep. As her head gradually lowers down, it finally rests on the open sandwich. The customer records the full video until the end. &#8220;This lady fell asleep on my sandwich&#8221; reads the caption of the video.  And, it has gained 39k comments so far.</p>

<p>The video eventually made it to Twitter where a user, @iJustBeKoolin, claimed that this incident took place at a Subway in Oregon. Some people found the video hilarious, while other found it heartbreaking.  &#8220;This is actually really sad. I can’t imagine how underslept she is. Not to mention the wage people get paid at Subway&#8230; She deserves better,&#8221; wrote Monique Emilia, a TikTok user. Even skincare influencer Hyram expressed her sentiments in the comments: &#8220;Poor thing&#8230; Can’t imagine how underslept she is, we’re too hard on service workers.&#8221;</p>

<p>YouTuber Garrett Watts commented saying: &#8220;Man this is more heartbreaking than anything. I hope she&#8217;s ok.&#8221; According to a survey, the average hourly wage of a worker at Subway is anywhere close to $8 and $9 in 2019. It is considerably lower than the $15 per hour demanded by workers in the Fight for $15. A movement, involving all fast-food workers, adjunct professors, child care teachers, retail employees, airport workers, home health aides, and more, points out that while &#8220;low-wage employers everywhere are making billions of dollars in profit and pushing off costs onto taxpayers,&#8221;. The actual labour class that does all the work, and has to struggle to get their daily wages.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can’t feed our families, pay our bills, or even keep a roof over our heads on minimum wage pay,&#8221; states the movement. In 2012 nearly two hundred fast-food workers kicked their jobs to demand $15/hr and union rights in NYC. Meanwhile, some people suggest that the Subway worker in the video was not exhausted by the job, rather was under the influence of some drugs. &#8220;That is not &#8216;no sleep&#8217; or &#8216;underslept&#8217;&#8230; That&#8217;s knodding [sic] out&#8230; Strong drugs, unfortunately. If you know, you know&#8230; I wish her healing,&#8221; wrote a TikTok user ThatUniqueLife.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just hope she gets help! She really doesn&#8217;t need you filming her at her lowest. Maybe ask if she&#8217;s alright instead,&#8221; commented Pat Drake. Meanwhile, the TikToker who initially posted the video gave her finally comment: &#8220;Can y&#8217;all stop with the negative comments. The lady woke up after the video ended. She is fine. She just needs to not do drugs before work.&#8221;</p>
