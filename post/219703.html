			<p>Walmart CEO Doug McMillon gave a very serious warning on Tuesday: If the theft issue doesn&#8217;t stop, the company will close stores all over the country.</p>
<blockquote><p>Theft is an issue,</p></blockquote>
<p>he told CNBC.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is higher than what it has historically been.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then added,</p>
<blockquote><p>If that&#8217;s not corrected over time, prices will be higher, and/or stores will close.</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Walmart CEO on rise in retail theft: Prices could go higher and stores will close" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6iWgizk6kH4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>During the interview, McMillon did not say how much money Walmart has lost this year because of stolen items. When an insider asked Walmart for that number, they didn&#8217;t answer right away.</p>
<p>But a source reported in 2015 that the biggest store in the world probably loses about 1% of its US sales, or about $3 billion, every year because customers and employees steal.</p>
<p>McMillon said that the best way to stop theft is for Walmart to work with local law enforcement agencies and make sure they have enough people to do their jobs.</p>
<p>The retail giant based in Bentonville, Arkansas, isn&#8217;t the only store that has recently warned customers about theft.</p>
<p>Target&#8217;s gross margin has gone down by more than $400 million in 2022 compared to last year because of missing inventory. Target&#8217;s CFO, Michael Fiddelke, said in November during a company earnings call that the company expects these profit losses to grow to $600 million by the end of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>Target mostly blamed organized crime for the loss of inventory.</p>
<p>During the earnings call, Brian Cornell, who is the CEO of Target, said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Along with other retailers, we&#8217;ve seen a significant increase in theft and organized retail crime across our business.</p></blockquote>
