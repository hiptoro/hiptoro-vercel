			<p>How often do we remember our teachers who put extra effort to teach us? Probably, only on the Teacher&#8217;s Day, right? Have you ever thanked them for their selfless and commendable job? It is believed that a teacher&#8217;s role in the academic achievement of a student is twice or thrice more than the other factors related to school. And we hardly take a moment to thank them.</p>
<p>Teachers are known for their ingenuity and dedication. And these 19 teachers will surely make you remember your favorite lecturer from your high school. Also, our teachers deserve much respect and care. Even during the coronavirus lockdown, these tutors worked even harder to impart education using online platforms.
