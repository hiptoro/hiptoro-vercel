			<p>We humans often forget that domesticated animals like dogs and cats see the world in a much simpler way than we do. As our pets get used to living with us on a daily basis, they start to pick up some of our habits and personalities. This, of course, supports the idea that these cute little animals are, in the end, not that different from us. When we can&#8217;t stop laughing because of how funny it is that they don&#8217;t understand or misunderstand something, we first realize how simple and naive these guys are.</p>
<p>Sometimes we overestimate how much we need the products, or the sellers send us the wrong ones, and things start to go wrong before our pets even get to see what we bought for them. But when it comes to being completely unaware of the things we do, our pets really step up to the plate.</p>
<p>We put together a list of pet owners&#8217; pictures of their pets&#8217; strange and funny reactions to the gifts they were given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>When all you wanted to do was give your dog a comfortable place to sleep, but it ended up working out even better than you could have imagined. It&#8217;s just not how you thought it would happen.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The owner of this cat decided to buy it a window hammock because the cat seems to spend most of its time looking out the window.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-214549" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cat-staring-2.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="546" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cat-staring-2.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/cat-staring-2-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>“So glad I bought my cat a window hammock.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The order for the automatic ball thrower didn&#8217;t go as planned.</h2>

<p>“— Ordered an automatic dog ball launcher but got a tennis ball instead.<br />
— You’re the ball launcher now.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s probably safe to say that cats aren&#8217;t very mean.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-214547" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/went-drain.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="487" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/went-drain.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/went-drain-300x201.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Cats are simple creatures. You make them a comfortable place to relax, but no matter what you do, they will never go there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>When this dog started sleeping in the shark&#8217;s bed, its mood got worse.</h2>

<p>Well, more like sooper angry!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>That betrayed look just seems to scream, “Don’t tell me YOU are the cat-hater in question, hooman. Don’t you dare!”</h2>

<p>“Nice bed, but I certainly won’t sleep in it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>At least they weren&#8217;t lying when they advertised their product by saying it would make your dog happy and smile.</h2>

<p>Because they are inherently good, our domesticated animals give us an endless supply of the happiness and love we need so much. When we spend our own money to make their lives a little bit happier and more comfortable, it gives us a lot of pleasure to see how our efforts have helped. On the other hand, it is funny to see their funny faces when the things we buy for them don&#8217;t work out as planned.</p>

<h2>The box you were about to throw away will always be your cat&#8217;s favorite one.</h2>

<p>“I have 2 cat trees and cat beds all over the place, but my cat would rather sleep in our fake tree.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>After what just happened, at least the cat has a reason not to come back to this area anymore.</h2>

<p>“Ever since we started using an automatic feeder, my cat sits in front of it like this for hours waiting for it to feed her.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Is this how artists in the Middle Ages painted portraits of their pets, like cats?</h2>

<p>“I bought my indoor cat a square of grass, and I think I broke his brain. He’s been staring at it like this for 20 minutes.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hey Hooman, I can promise you I didn&#8217;t do that.</h2>

<p>Because the cat&#8217;s owner didn&#8217;t call, the cat spent the whole night posing for pictures in front of the camera. Because of this, we shouldn&#8217;t ever keep the people we care about waiting.</p>
