<p>Denzel Washington was sad because his mother had passed away.</p>
<p>On an episode of &#8220;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,&#8221; the 66-year-old actor talked about the death of his mother, Lennis Washington. She died in June 2021 when she was 97.</p>
<p>The actor who played Macbeth in Tragedy of Macbeth thanked host Stephen Colbert for his support and said, &#8220;A son&#8217;s first true love is his mother. &#8220;A mother&#8217;s last true love is her son, especially her first son,&#8221; he said, then started to cry.</p>

<p>Denzel went on, asking for a tissue, &#8220;She was there for everything, and then she went home.&#8221; When Denzel won Best Supporting Actor for his role in Glory at the 1990 Oscars, Colbert showed an old photo of the actor, his wife Pauletta, and his mother Lennis.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>In the picture, the mother was standing next to her son, beaming with pride.</p>
<p>The winner of two Oscars said, “This is terrible! And I held back my tears during her funeral.&#8221;</p>
<p>“What do you believe?” Colbert enquired. &#8220;I suppose I had it in reserve for you,&#8221; he made a joke.</p>
<p>Lennis was born in 1924 in Harlem, New York, where she grew up. She married Rev. Denzel H. Washington Sr. in 1949, and they had three children together: sons Denzel and David, and a daughter Lorice. Lennis was a beautician who ran many salons in Mount Vernon, New York, where her family lived. She was also religious.</p>
<p>Denzel said this about their powerful bond: “I don’t know if I was her favorite because I was the most difficult for her. I can confirm that.” In the end, the actor told the audience to &#8220;hug&#8221; and &#8220;love&#8221; their closest loved ones while they still can.</p>
