			<h2>Who is that?</h2>
<p>Can you see that weird-shocked expression on the cats face while she is staring at the dog? This is her &#8216;I don&#8217;t know who you are?&#8217; face after her dog friend returned home from a grooming session.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-152726 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-65.jpg" alt="" width="643" height="540" /></p>
<h2>Why the haircut?</h2>
<p>Whether it is a toy poodle or a full-size poodle, this dog breed doesn&#8217;t have fur. They have hair, like really big and curly hair that requires a lot of care. You have to comb your dog often, and they are certainly high maintenance dogs.</p>

<h2>Non-Shed</h2>
<p>If you believe that poodles don&#8217;t shed their hair, you are highly mistaken. You might not find much hair on the floor because, the hair that shed get tangled with the curls and it becomes a mess. Therefore, it is very essential that you take them to the groomer regularly.</p>

<h2>You’ve got to be kidding me!</h2>
<p>The ty poodle who had to go through the grooming doesn&#8217;t look quite happy with his new look.</p>

<h2>High-Maintenance.</h2>
