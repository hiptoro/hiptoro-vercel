			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living in a shelter house is any dog’s worst nightmare. No furry baby wants to live there and when the situation forces them to do, they forgets to smile. However, there is a cute pitbull living in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Front Street Animal Shelter in Sacramento, California that is smiling brightly. Yes, you have read that right! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of this cutie is Riley and she was found wandering around the streets. That’s when in the last December, a homeless person brought her to this shepherd’s house. This was done so she could get a better life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This cutie is 2-years-old and she is very sociable. Even though California’s shelter house is crowded with pit bulls, this adorable puppy has managed to gain attention with her sweet smile. As Riley has a vibrant and joyous personality, Britney Ridge, Kennel’s technician came up with a great idea to get her adopted. </span></p>

<p>“My kennel technician, Britney Ridge, fell in love with her personality and for whatever reason thought that Riley was one of those dogs that could smile”. “So every day during feeding and cleaning, they would talk to each other.”</p>

<p>Scroll down to see her beautiful smile.</p>
<p>A gentle update: Riley’s smile has won the heart of several people and she has been adopted. Now, she lives happily with her new family in her new home.</p>
