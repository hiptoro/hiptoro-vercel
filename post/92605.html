			<p>Recently a woman named Shannon Cooper, poured water over her neighbor&#8217;s son after he did the same to her cat. She has gone viral after Tweeting about the incident all over the internet.</p>
<p>After sharing her post she ignited a Twitter debate about who was in the right. Cooper has revealed why she threw a basin of water over her young neighbor after he had poured a cup of water over her pet cat.</p>
<p>She explained-</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My 10 year old neighbour just threw a cup of water over my cat who was sitting on the fence minding his own business n laughed so I threw a basin of water over him from the window and now his dad is at my door going mental but I don&#8217;t see the problem, don&#8217;t touch my cat.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>After Shannon&#8217;s post, there was an intense debate about whether or not it was right to pour water on the child. She soon revealed the boy was actually 13 years old, he just &#8220;looks 10&#8221;.</p>
<p>She further added &#8211; soon after water was thrown over her the little boy, the child&#8217;s father was angry at her. The father suggested that the boy did nothing as there is no harm to an innocent pet.</p>

<p>The woman received a lot of mixed reactions on her tweet. One also asked for the pic of the cat.</p>

<h3>The tweet got hilarious comments and memes</h3>
<p>One Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/dysphoricethan2/status/1263229616224972935">wrote</a>&#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;BAHAHAHHAHA ITS WATER the dad needs to chill. He should teach his kid to be nice to animals. I would&#8217;ve answered the door to a bucket of water in his face [sic].&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>They <a href="https://twitter.com/dysphoricethan2/status/1263229616224972935">added</a>&#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[C<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-1qd0xha r-ad9z0x r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">ruelty] to animals is early signs of a serial killer too. </span>they let this go unchecked?? their sons [sic] new home will be a cage.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Another posted this hilarious meme-</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/bags_of_gold/status/1263421098382721026</p>
<p>A fifth remarked &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At 10 I used to stare at cats with my father in awe cause I couldn&#8217;t have pets and at 3 I used talked to plants &amp; trees cause my father told me they are living and feel hurt if you pluck leaves. What that kid need is better parenting.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, this is what some of Shannon&#8217;s critics said about the incident. One wrote &#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I get your point but as a parent I would&#8217;ve been pissed too. If my child is doing wrong you come and talk to me about it and I will correct it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>https://twitter.com/Fal_Neil/status/1263580926350508032</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">She actually did a favour to the kid and the dad. Cats like any other animal can be unpredictable. Better a wet shirt today than a scratched eye tomorrow.</p>

<p>Shannon got a lot of advice from the users. So what do you think about Shannon&#8217;s actions?</p>
<p>Did the woman went right to teach the boy a lesson herself or should she have told his parent and let them decide what the appropriate response was?</p>
