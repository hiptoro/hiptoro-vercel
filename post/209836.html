			<p>Fortunately, it was captured on camera when a cute baby girl with Down syndrome wanted to give her new adoptive mother a big smile. After being posted to the National Down Syndrome Adoption Network Facebook page, the video received thousands of reactions. The family of 8-month-old &#8220;Baby H&#8221; now resides in Texas. This name was chosen to protect the child&#8217;s privacy during the adoption process.</p>

<p>When her mother asked Baby H how her day was going while they were both lounging on a blanket, her adorable face burst into the infamous grin!</p>
<p>&#8220;When Baby H was almost eight months old, she woke up one morning with this brand-new smile,&#8221; her mom said to The Daily Mail. &#8220;We noticed it several times and realized she was showing us a cheesy grin–we laughed and laughed every time she did it and she just loved the attention.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter  wp-image-209838" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/9ab02fb3185fab6eecdad2281ac97a9c_500x1.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="591" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/9ab02fb3185fab6eecdad2281ac97a9c_500x1.jpg 500w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/9ab02fb3185fab6eecdad2281ac97a9c_500x1-300x244.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>In the interview, her mother also mentioned that she had noticed that Baby H could smile on command. Her mother says in the following segment of the video, &#8220;Ohh I love your new smile! That is the cutest! Can you show me again?&#8221;</p>
<p>Naturally, Baby H just has to give her a big smile when she hears her mother&#8217;s voice. Then you hear her mother say, &#8220;Oh my goodness I like that new smile!&#8221;</p>

<p>In an interview with The Daily Mail, her mother said that she laughed because she adores her child&#8217;s smile so much.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can tell by my laughter how much we adore this smile and she actually only smiled like this for a couple of weeks so this video is a treasure for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope that all the viewers will see the beauty that lies in people with Down Syndrome,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;Although a Down Syndrome diagnosis can be scary, the reality is that your child has a purpose and will be able to live a full and happy life.&#8221;</p>
