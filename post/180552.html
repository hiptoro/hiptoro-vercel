<p>&#8220;Though it’s important for individuals to take part in the reuse revolution movement and do their best to reduce their plastic footprints, the responsibility lies on the multinationals that produce single-use plastic packaging in the first place,&#8221; a Greenpeace representative told Bored Panda.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the big challenges we are faced with is the corporation&#8217;s addiction to single-use plastic and their relationship with the fossil fuel industry. As global demand for oil declines, the fossil fuel industry is doubling down on plastic, the new frontier for petrochemical production.”</p>

<p>Greenpeace claims that big corporations are working hand-in-hand with the fossil fuel industry while putting up an eco-friendly front.</p>
<p>“While big brands like Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and Pepsi claim they are addressing the plastic pollution crisis, they are working hand-in-hand with the fossil fuel industry and making even more plastic,” the rep said.</p>
<p>“As it stands, plastic production could double within the next 10-15 years, and triple by 2050. This is alarming, especially if we are to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees. Plastic is an important part of moving away from fossil fuels, combating climate change, and protecting communities.&#8221;</p>
