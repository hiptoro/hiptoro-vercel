			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you also looking for a great sleeping bed for your beautiful feline? If yes, maybe you should stop and invest that money somewhere else. Why? It’s because that expensive and comfortable bed you are planning to buy will be useless. Oh, no. Cats have a sleeping habit and it is very weird. They don’t like sleeping on the cozy bed that is made just for them. Instead, they will find a box, a dark box, and will sleep there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This habit is creating a problem for the cat owners. But hopefully, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">designers, known as Catlife are creating a way through. They have actually designed a bed that is comfortable and spacious for both owners and cats. The labyrinth design of the bed is safe and your cat will like it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This designer company took Instagram and said “with our bed, our cat clients don’t feel invaded in their territory. Nor do they have to run looking for a safe space to hide. Under this bed, they find a quiet place, full of calm and security. And best of all, it still has the same functionality for the owner! You will continue to rest as you normally would. But now, you provide a unique den to your cat.”</span></p>

<p>“With passageways and beds that our cat clients can use to sleep, rest, and hide when they feel invaded in their territory, the main function of the bed is to serve as a safe place for the cats.” <span style="font-weight: 400;">This bed comes with two side tables, decorations, and a mattress. And the price of this bed ranges from $550 to $680. C’mon, you can spend that much money for your cat’s comfort, can’t you? </span></p>
<p>The creators of the bed further added “with our furniture, you can not only continue to enjoy your bed normally but also, you are giving a very special place to your kitten, every cat lover would like to have this bed!”</p>

<p>“Catlife was born in 2013. Its creators are David and Naty, a couple of Colombian entrepreneurs from Duitama Boyacá, based in the city of Medellín. We have always sought for our ‘Catclients’ (that’s what we call the kittens in our community) to be able to satisfy their innate needs and, at the same time, we try to make the furniture beautiful for the home. At this time, we manage traditional cat beds and play areas, but also, thinking about the life that we have with them as owners and in order to optimize space, we created our home line: multifunctional furniture for human and feline use such as the bed, nightstands, studios, entertainment centers, libraries, and many more products.”</p>

<p>“We handle various materials. Mainly our clients prefer pine wood, but we also manufacture it in oak and melamine. Our materials come from planted forests (sustainable wood).”</p>

<p>“Today, we are on the verge of releasing our new design so that the mattress can be raised with a hydraulic system so that cleaning will be much easier!”</p>

<p>The designers further answered some of the frequently asked questions. “<em>What if the cat does its business underneath the bed?</em> Cats are one of the cleanest animals that exist in nature; they only relieve themselves in their litter box, so they will never do it under your bed. Now, if your cat urinates anywhere else, it may have a health problem or a behavioral problem, and in that case, it is important that you pay attention to these behaviors, because they are not normal and your kitten may be having a very bad time. If this is your situation, the bed would not be the ideal option until your kitten is in good health.</p>
<p><em>Is it hard to get the cat from under the bed?</em> Do not force the cat out. The bed is there to be a safe place. If you take it out by force, it will stop being so. Unlike your cat, you do know when you are going to have to take it somewhere, so you can close the accesses beforehand so that your kitten does not enter the bed.</p>
<p><em>Will there be problems when I want to sleep?</em> Cats are very intelligent animals. Just as they know what a litter box or feeder is for, they also know what their den is for, so they will only use it to protect themselves and to rest. However, not all cats are the same, so if yours is very active and you are a light sleeper, it is probably not your ideal bed.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-114395 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-42.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="901" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-42.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/6-42-233x300.jpg 233w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>“The bed is ideal for shy, skittish, and nervous cats looking for a safe place to go when they feel vulnerable or want to rest quietly. The security, comfort, and peace that the bed offers them is unique. It’s that place that every cat would like to have at home.”</p>
