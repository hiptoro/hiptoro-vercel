			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever been to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shreveport, Louisiana? It’s a beautiful town that has been heavily affected by extreme cold. And since this place has never seen such harsh weather before, its residents began to experience problems. Like power outages and shutdowns in their water systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the list of people who got uncomfortable due to heavy snow, Marie and her family are also one. But she acted smartly. Due to this climate, they did not get running water for five days in a row, and her children desperately needed a bath!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, she along with her husband began to look for a solution. She then came up with a brilliant idea of her own. You can scroll down to see her brilliant idea. </span></p>
