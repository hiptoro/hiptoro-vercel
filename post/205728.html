			<p>Sometimes, people, we love on television turn out to be real heroes in real life. The man who played Superman in the TV series, Lois and Clark: The new adventures of Superman is Dean Cain. The story of a single father who gave up his career to take care of his son is proof that there are superheroes. We believe that it is a great example to set for all parents, and that is why we want to share his story with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. He had a rough childhood.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-205736" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/59869b5adeb6c689caac52d9ef.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="1067" /></p>
<p>Although he would eventually become a world-renowned star, Dean Cain experienced a tough childhood. The boy and his mother were abandoned by his father, who never got to meet his biological father. His mother married a man when he was 4. His father didn&#8217;t get in contact with him again.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-205735" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/6eb8f25a3081048e8ff42a43be.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="1133" /></p>
<p>The actor was shaped by his fractured relationship with his father. He was a father to a son with his girlfriend. In spite of a long custody battle, Cain got sole custody in 2011. The actor made sure that his son wouldn&#8217;t go through the same things that he did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. He made many sacrifices and raised his son all by himself.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-205734" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/156c585f0a8542d2ad51f92ced.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="641" /></p>
<p>Every step of the way, the Superman actor made sure to be there for his son, even cooking for him.</p>
<p>He shared, “I cook every meal for my child. If I don’t cook, he doesn’t eat. I cook a very mean steak. I’m also very good at taking the 9 leftovers I have and turning them into something.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-205733" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/7bfa3850c684167509fa5a1409.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="940" /></p>
<p>Despite the fact that he proceeded to act and bring up his child alone simultaneously, the actor tried to be there constantly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. He doesn’t regret his decision.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-205732" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/f6d9c4525b92db4b6e402604e5.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="476" /></p>
<p>The actor’s decision to put his career on hold and focus on raising his son has earned him a lot of criticism, but Cain said, “I’m there. I’m a very present father, and I would never do it otherwise.” Even though he is raising his son alone, he doesn’t regret it. “People are, like, ‘Haven’t you been aspiring for anything?’ Yeah, I’ve aspired for a life!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>4. They both share an unbreakable bond.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-205731" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ce906a5dcebdcb1f8061dd5bf4.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="546" /></p>
<p>Dean and his son share an unbreakable bond. The actor has shared adorable pictures of the 2 of them together on Instagram and has <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/things-dean-cain/story?id=27401545" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">stated</a>, “I think he’s pretty proud of Dad, but to be honest, I’m pretty proud of him. I think he’s my favorite human being on the planet.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>5. He is a real-life Superman.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-205730" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/6a410a5bc8a9682493efd26f48.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="530" /></p>
<p>A great example of the love parents have for their children is the sacrifice made by Cain for his son. The actor put his son first despite having a successful career. By making sure his son wouldn&#8217;t go through a rough childhood as he did, he became Superman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>6. He continues to work on his career as well.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-205729" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1e496f51589e7d84a7c8a80fb2.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="839" /></p>
<p>A great example of the love parents have for their children is the sacrifice made by Cain for his son. The actor put his son first despite having a successful career. By making sure his son wouldn&#8217;t go through a rough childhood as he did, he became Superman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you remember a time when you appreciated the sacrifice your parents made for you? Do you think single parents can do the same things?</p>
