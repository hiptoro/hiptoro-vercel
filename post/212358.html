			<p>The former detective who brought to light Jimmy Savile&#8217;s sexual predatory behavior claims that there is another &#8220;untouchable&#8221; figure that he is working to bring to justice.</p>
<p>Mark Williams-Thomas made headlines in 2012 when he exposed the DJ in an ITV documentary titled The Other Side of Jimmy Savile, which aired a year after the entertainer passed away at the age of 84. The documentary was titled The Other Side of Jimmy Savile.</p>
<p>The documentary caused quite a stir in the industry, and in the days that followed the documentary&#8217;s broadcast, numerous victims came forward to discuss their experiences with Savile.</p>
<p>A decade later, Williams-Thomas stated in an interview with inews that there is another &#8220;significant person&#8221; that is being concealed from the public by the media.</p>
<p>The former investigator stated the following to the news organization: “There are still people out there who are untouchable.</p>
<p>“There is one very significant person who I have done everything to try and get prosecuted because he is clearly a child s** offender.”</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>Williams-Thomas continued by asserting that in spite of this worry, the Crown Prosecution Service has not yet brought charges against the person of interest.</p>
<p>The investigator continued by saying: “The police and I have tried really hard to get there.</p>
<p>“He will die in due course and then the floodgates will open in the same way they did with Savile.</p>
<p>“That’s not right. But justice takes many different forms.”</p>
<p>Williams-Thomas did not provide any additional information about the &#8220;significant person&#8221; in her response. Nevertheless, he did give the impression that the investigation might move forward if the victims waived their right to remain anonymous.</p>

<h6></h6>
<p>According to The Irish Mirror, he stated: “I’ve seen the value of lifting anonymity for victims to come forward. It’s one of the reasons the CPS didn’t have evidence to prosecute Savile when he was alive.”</p>
<p>Williams-Thomas continued by stating that the media plays a &#8220;vital role&#8221; in getting victims to come forward and provide their statements.</p>
<p>After hearing Williams-Thomas&#8217; allegations, Metro contacted the Crown Prosecution Service to inquire about obtaining additional information.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the CPS was quoted as saying to the news outlet: “The CPS takes cases of child s**ual abuse incredibly seriously, and will consider any case referred to us by the police.”</p>
<p>Savile was a well-known media personality in the UK and was popular due to the work that he did for charitable organizations. On the other hand, allegations of sexual abuse of children surfaced after his passing in 2011. This occurred in 2011.</p>
<p>The next year saw the beginning of an official investigation into criminal activity, which was given the codename &#8220;Operation Yewtree.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Crime+Investigation UK, the investigation was initially launched with the purpose of examining the allegations that surfaced in the wake of the ITV series.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Daily Express, a spokesperson for the NSPCC described the response to Operation Yewtree as &#8220;unprecedented.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The outcry led to greater public awareness about child sexual abuse, recognition of the importance of giving victims a voice, and empowered survivors to break the silence and speak out – which in turn led to the apprehension of other abusers including other celebrities,” the representative commented.</p>
