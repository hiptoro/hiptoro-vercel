<p>Photos were mostly used to enhance the text rather than as a medium of information. The work of John Thomson, one of the pioneers of photojournalism, began to change this in the late 1870s.</p>
<p>Street Life in London was published from 1876 to 1877. The project documented the lives of the street people of London in photographs and text.</p>
<p>He pioneered the use of printed photographs as the main medium for the dissemination of information, instead of the images acting as a supplement to the text.</p>
