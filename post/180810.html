			<p>What is your favorite Christmas movie? It can be hard to pick a good one. There are classics like &#8220;It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life&#8221; and &#8220;White Christmas&#8221;, but then there are more modern classics like &#8220;Elf&#8221; and &#8220;A Christmas Story.</p>
<p>Do you remember the movie “Christmas Story”? The main character is a little boy named Ralphie who wants a Red Ryder BB Gun for Christmas.</p>
<p>The movie portrayed what it used to be. There is a lot of controversy over guns. We are not sure if a family film with a little boy who wants a gun for Christmas would make it to theaters today.</p>
<p>Gun control is a sensitive topic indeed and even Kate Middleton couldn&#8217;t escape the accusation of not being sensitive enough towards the same.</p>
<p>You might wonder what Amy Haehl was thinking when she took a picture of a baby posing with a fake gun. She thought she could recreate the movie A Christmas Story.</p>
<p>The photo was there on Haehl&#8217;s Facebook business page. She said in the text that the wood used to make the gun was to make sure he didn&#8217;t shoot his eye out during the creation of the photo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The picture that Haehl posted, of the baby.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the photo got more and more views online, she was right about it being controversial. Commenters stated said that they would be unfollowing her. They said &#8220;Someone would take a picture of a baby and a gun for the money. You are so talented, and that&#8217;s a waste. Think about your lack of principles.&#8221;</p>
<p>She is defending her choice. This photo is not about a baby with a gun, but about love, tradition, family, and happiness. For 35 years, this movie has encouraged smiles, laughter, and happiness.</p>
<p>The negative comments draw attention to her business, but not everyone thinks the photo is appropriate. Some commenters even said &#8220;This is the prettiest thing I have ever seen. This recreation of the film is amazing. New follower!&#8221;</p>
<p>What are your views on the picture that Haehl posted? Do you think it&#8217;s inappropriate?</p>
