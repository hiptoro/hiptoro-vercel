			<p>Your pets are a part of your family. Just like we panic when our child goes out missing. In the same way, our world turns upside-down when a pet is missing from the house. From registering a complaint in the police station, putting out posters of missing out, and letting everyone on social media know of their absence, we do it all.</p>
<p>A dog named Zeus, a pit bull mix and lives in Butte, Montana, was stolen in October. Along with some of his owner Cassandra’s things as well. Fortunately, it turned out that it was a ‘friend’ who robbed Cassandra. The great thing is that he was 2,000 miles away about a week ago, and Zeus was still with him!</p>
<p>The long journey was supported by Many Paws Volunteer Transport which coordinated the canine’s journey across the US, as well as the Kanawha Charleston Humane Association, which posted updates about the dog’s trip. It took over a dozen volunteers (or “30 legs and 3 sleepovers”</p>
<h2>Zeus the dog was stolen and ended up 2,000 miles away. It took 15 volunteers (or “30 legs”) to get him back home</h2>
