			<p>Megan Fox is one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. She&#8217;s also a mom to three boys and one of the quintessential actresses of the 2000s. I know, right? She is a superwoman.</p>
<p>She makes headlines for her relationship with Machine Gun Kelly, but I think it&#8217;s time she was praised for her parenting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Megan Fox has been making headlines a lot this past year because of her relationship with Machine Gun Kelly.</h2>
<p>The Transformers actress keeps her personal life out of the public eye.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-202473" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/272092652_954965655441155_1099301929220824531_n.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="1800" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Megan was married to Brian Austin Green for 10 years before calling it quits.</h2>
<p>They had three sons together, including Noah Shannon, Bodhi Ransom, and Journey River.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-202472" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/31157043_630839110609920_4634104858654277632_n.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Megan spoke about her son&#8217;s interest in wearing dresses in a previous interview, and in a new interview with Glamour UK, the 35-year-old updated fans on their journey.</h2>
<p>“Noah started wearing dresses when he was about two, and I bought a bunch of books that sort of addressed these things and addressed a full spectrum of what this is,&#8221; she <a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/megan-fox-digital-cover-interview-april-2022" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-202471" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/43292472_279574766012359_2281659019001328194_n.jpg" alt="" width="777" height="559" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">&#8220;Some of the books are written by transgender children. Some of the books are just about how you can be a boy and wear a dress; you can express yourself through your clothing however you want.&#8221;</h2>
<p>She wanted her son to understand that his desire to wear dresses was not related to his sexuality.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-202470" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/18889132_1660044050673620_6313417241526272_n.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">&#8220;From the time they were very young, I’ve incorporated those things into their daily lives so that nobody feels like they are weird or strange or different,&#8221; she said.</h2>
<p>“I can’t control the way other people react to my children. I can’t control the things that other children – that they go to school with – have been taught and then repeat to them.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-202469" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/10514117_257472957781029_753843955_n.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="640" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>She said that she is hesitant to share her children on social media.</h2>
<p>&#8220;I’m so proud of my kids. Noah is an unbelievable pianist. He can learn Mozart’s concerto in an hour,&#8221; she shared. &#8220;I want people to see that, but I also don’t want the world to have access to this gentle soul and say all the things that we all know they’re going to say.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-202468" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/273729802_680858979585233_649536646885211645_n.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="1800" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>She knows that many of her children&#8217;s classmates have famous parents who keep their children away from social media.</h2>
<p>&#8220;So far, we’ve done a really good job and we maintain their innocence in a lot of ways, but I know I can’t protect them forever, though I do have a child that suffers.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-202467" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/200659767_522664939092267_2266279744595560010_n.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="1800" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Megan wishes for a more inclusive world for her children.</h2>
<p>&#8220;I have a lot of worries about that because I just wish that humanity was not like this. Although my kid is so brave and my child is so brave and I know that they’ve chosen this journey for a reason. It’s just hard as a mom.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure many parents can relate to Megan&#8217;s job.</p>
