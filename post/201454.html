			<p>More and more people are opting for life without kids for a variety of reasons. The societal pressure to have babies is still going strong, but women as mothers have been more vocal about their life choices.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t hear much about the other side of being a mother. More women are willing to talk about not being satisfied with being a mother in a way that society expects them to. This doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s easy. Women who dare to challenge this taboo and express their regrets are often called &#8220;selfish,&#8221; &#8220;whining,&#8221; and even &#8220;bad moms.</p>
<p>“Mothers who regret having children, what made you realize it? And how are you coping?” someone recently asked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/u5pi4y/mothers_who_regret_having_children_what_made_you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a daring question on the Ask Women</a> subreddit. It hit a nerve for many women, who saw it as an opportunity to share their feelings about being a mom. The thread gives a perspective from women who question the decision that is often taken for granted in our society.</p>

<p>I love my daughter. She is the most important thing in my life.</p>
<p>I have started to regret having a child. Not because of her. She&#8217;s the sweetest little girl you could ever meet.</p>
<p>I regret having children because of what is happening in the world. When I think about her future, I feel doom and anxiety. She won&#8217;t be able to afford a house and will struggle with debt, climate change, and growing inequality. I feel so guilty that I am terrified.</p>
<p>I would not have a child now if I were childless. Despite loving being a mother, the growing despair I see every day and the knowledge things will only get worse in the next 30 years make me regret having children. I am sad that this is the future she will have, I love her with all my heart. I&#8217;m sad I put her in this situation. Many of my friends with children feel the same.</p>
<p>I try to make society better for her generation, but I know it won&#8217;t be. I save as much as I can for her so that I can help her in the future. She needs to be taught about fairness and self-reliance. It is a major stress in the back of my mind.</p>

<p>I am not a good mother. I don&#8217;t know how to raise them. They are raising themselves with me. Generational trauma, insane pedophile dad. I was young and groomed.</p>
<p>I can learn and grow even though I traumatized my kids. Help them. The damage has been done. I wish I could fix myself so I could help them, but I can&#8217;t. When they want to shut me out in 10 years, I will always support them. I will get it. Yes. F**k man. I’ll keep trying and I’ve had them in therapy. I am learning while I am in therapy. But yeah. I was too young to know. I didn&#8217;t choose their sperm contributions well.</p>

<p>I have two kids who are 2 years old but are legally adults. They have a number of mental disorders. Trying to navigate this world is a nightmare and I have gotten no help from the state. It doesn&#8217;t help that the world isn&#8217;t prepared for an aging population or a disabled population.</p>
<p>I regretted having them because they wouldn&#8217;t be able to care for themselves. I will have to put them in a home of some sort because the likelihood of being sexually abused goes up 7x. They don&#8217;t understand why they can&#8217;t be at home more. I wouldn&#8217;t have had kids if I could go back in time.</p>
<p>None of us have friends. Every day we stay at home and watch the internet until we pass out and the next day starts again. It&#8217;s terrible.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what made me regret it. It&#8217;s either a lie or completely glossed over that our society tells women about the challenges of having children, or it&#8217;s a lie to discourage women from having children.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see how many people were involved. Doctors, nurses, older women, and men around me. &#8220;Sshh, don&#8217;t tell them, they might change their mind.&#8221; Every step of the way has had some heavy challenges associated with it. Even though the same parents&#8217; experience of it will affect the child, there are no full disclosures to potential parents.</p>
<p>When I reached out to others for advice, the typical response was &#8220;Welcome to my world.&#8221; What?! Really? You say you love me but didn&#8217;t actually warn me how much damage my body and life would take? &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s normal.&#8221; Really? I have never seen that discussed in-depth in a documentary, informational video, or woman&#8217;s magazine. There is only one small story, surrounded by lots of messages about how great it will be. This makes me angry to no end.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t do it if I could go back. This is coming from a mother. A child whom I ***have*** warned: &#8220;Having a child might ruin your life. Don&#8217;t do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>My mental health takes a back burner because I spend a lot of time with kids. I had therapy before I found out my struggles are related to the disorder. I still work to make life easier, but one of my boys is not normal, and I think it&#8217;s harder than I thought it would be.</p>

<p>My kids would save me. I love the stories where your kids give you a reason to love. I wake up every morning wishing I didn&#8217;t. My desire to no longer exist has not been changed by any therapy or medicine.</p>

<p>“Women are supposed to be delighted to give birth and take care of a small child, even if it is very boring, especially for educated and emancipated women who are used to doing interesting things in their lives (friends, culture, meaningful work&#8230;),” the psychoanalyst (Maier) explained.</p>
