			<p><em>A young millionaire mum who already has a large family has revealed her jaw-dropping plans to have “dozens” more kids – costing $1.5m.</em></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t you agree looking after a single kid can make you exhausted and feel tired all day? Now imagine the life of a Russian woman who already has 11 babies.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, she has revealed she and her millionaire husband plan to have up to 105 biological children, after welcoming 10 babies by surrogate in just 10 months.</p>
<p>Christina Ozturk, 23, who is originally from Moscow, met her wealthy hotel owner husband Galip Ozturk, 56, while holidaying in the coastal town of Batumi in Georgia.</p>
<p>We interviewed the young mother to share a glimpse of her life with our audience. In the end, you’ll find a sweet video of all the kids.</p>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Christina, who gave birth to her daughter Vika at the age of 17, said the couple opted to use surrogate mothers because they wanted to quickly have as many children as possible.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Their first child Mustafa was born on 10th March 2020 while their most recent addition, and tenth child together Olivia, was born on 16th January 2021.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">The mother-of-11 revealed the pair have discussed having over 100 children, saying: &#8216;I don&#8217;t know how many there will eventually be, but we certainly don&#8217;t plan to stop at 10.&#8217;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Christina, who insists upon a strict childcare routine, claims her brood of 10 babies sleep &#8216;from 8 pm to 6 am&#8217; each night, and said the family&#8217;s nannies record each and every detail of the children in a set of diaries.</p>
<h2>The secret to having the largest family ever</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-197304" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-88.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="728" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-88.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-88-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-88-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2-88-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">She said it was love at first sight when she met Galip, a property and transport magnate originally from Turkey, on the first day there, and described him as her &#8216;mentor, guide and fairytale prince all rolled into one.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Agreeing it was love at first sight, Galip added: &#8216;She is so easy to be with, she always has a smile on her lips and yet at the same time is shy and mysterious.</p>
<div class="C7fk1eKyYhqHPN3_5hjqW">
<p>Most of Christina’s children were born at the same time and are of the same age! Since it is impossible, to have so many kids at once, she and her husband turned to surrogacy to build themselves a large family quickly. Even if she didn’t give birth to all of them, she’s still their biological momma. The couple wishes to have dozens more babies, but they have not planned an exact number yet.</p>

<div class="C7fk1eKyYhqHPN3_5hjqW">
<h2>It takes a village to take care of the babies.</h2>
</div>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-197305" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-90.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="686" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-90.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-90-300x283.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Her 56-year-old millionaire partner is a super dad who makes sure that everyone’s needs are met in the family. To help Christina take care of the kids in the best way, they’ve got nannies and several assistants.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-197306" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-89.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="444" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-89.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/4-89-300x183.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8216;She was the kind of wife I always wanted for myself, an uncut diamond where I saw what a pure and kind heart she had.&#8217; Things progressed quickly for the couple, with Christina and her young daughter Vika moving to Batumi to be with Galip.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;Christina said that despite the fact Galip was a lot older than her and had adult children of his own, he had no objections to having a large family. The couple agreed that they wanted as many children as they could. Christina said they were originally preparing to have a baby every year, however, quickly realized that her reproductive ability was not enough to meet their demands.&#8221;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;They decided to use surrogate mothers, which costs around $9,707 for each pregnancy. The state of Georgia has allowed surrogacy since 1997 as long as the couple involved are heterosexual and married. The child that is born automatically goes to the people who provided the genetic material for the conception, and the surrogate does not have any rights.&#8221;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;All of Christina&#8217;s potential surrogates go through counseling and sign legal paperwork before becoming pregnant with children that are genetically from Christina and her husband. Only young women who&#8217;ve already had at least one pregnancy are chosen, and checks are made to ensure that they don&#8217;t have any bad habits or addictions before joining the program.&#8221;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">The women are given psychological counseling to make sure that they are ready and prepared for the challenge, which will include giving up the baby when it&#8217;s born.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">Christina explained: &#8220;The clinic in Batumi chooses surrogate mothers for us and takes full responsibility for the process. We are not personally acquainted with surrogate mothers and do not have direct contact with them in order to avoid problems after pregnancy.&#8221;</p>

<h2>A regular day for Christina</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-197308" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-84.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="728" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-84.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-84-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-84-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/6-84-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;All communication takes place through the clinic, we only monitor health indicators, I make up a dietary menu for mothers so that the food is complete, I look at the test results.&#8221;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">The pair have gone on to welcome many children into their brood, with Christina explaining: &#8216;At the moment, I have 10 children with the latest addition, Olivia, who arrived at the end of last month.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;I gave birth to my eldest daughter Vika myself six years ago. The rest of the children are genetically ours from my husband and I, but were carried by surrogates.&#8221;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">But the journey has not been straightforward for the couple, with Christina revealing one of the surrogate mothers wanted to keep the child after it was born.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-197309" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7-84.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="456" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7-84.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7-84-300x188.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">She explained: &#8220;We just not ready to talk about the final number. Everything has its time.&#8221;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;The mother-of-11 revealed many people assume she has an army of nannies, but she says she tries to spend as much time as she can with her large family. Christina claims to do most of the day-to-day childcare herself and makes sure she spends each day giving care and attention to her babies. However, she also admitted looking after such a large number of children at once has proven more difficult than she thought it would be.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you had the time and money, would you like to have a large family too?</p>
