			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a story about a sweet boy Narnia who has stolen netizens&#8217; hearts back in 2018 when his photo with a unique characteristic featured online. He is an adorable cat and what is interesting about him is his face that is precisely split into a gray and a black side. Also, he has blue colored eyes. OMG! That’s an amazing combo. Narnia’s owner Stephanie Jiminez said that “When Narnia was born I was extremely surprised. I knew immediately that he was exceptional.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, Narnia has grown into a healthy and heartthrob cat and is the father of two amazing kittens. The best thing- both his babies took their fur color from either side of Narnia’s face. And they simply look stunning. Prada is black-hair while Phoenix is grey-hair.</span></p>
<h2>Narnia has conquered hearts on the internet with his unique split face</h2>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102650 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-22.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></p>
<h2>And recently, he became a dad to these two cutie pies in each color</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102651 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-23.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="815" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand how Narnia is managing to be famous and a new dad, we talked to Stephanie. She told us that “Narnia is very well and he loves playing with his kittens.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we talked more about Narnia, we got to know that it&#8217;s not the first time he has been a parent. He has been a father so many times and all of his kittens were of different color variations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other than beautiful Prada and Phoenix, Narnia also has two beautiful multicolored boys, Polaris and Phantom; pitch-black Roswell; gray Rose; and two light brown twins, Orfée and Ozanna. </span></p>
<h2>Seeing their mom and dad, good looks are surely in the genes</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102652 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-21.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="467" /></p>
<h2>Narnia’s blue eyes are show stoppers on their own</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102653 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-23.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102654 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6-23.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="875" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though Phoenix and Prada have not got the striking blue eyes as of their dad but the other kittens have inherited beauty. Stephanie says that “It is very rare, there are only a few cats in the world that are fully colored and have blue eyes. This is a new gene called ice.” She further told us that Narnia will soon be a father again. Yay! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Narnia was born in Paris, the city of love and now lives in Britain. Earlier, he was mistaken to be the rare chimera cat. But then Stephanie thought of getting genetic testing of Narnia. “A geneticist performed tests and [found] Narnia has only one DNA… there remains a mystery for science,” she said.</span></p>

<h2>Narnia’s owner Stephanie Jimenez said she knew the boy was exceptional since his birth</h2>

<h2>And people seemed stunned by this good-looking cat family</h2>
