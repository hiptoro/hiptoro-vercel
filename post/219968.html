			<p>A person from the United States said that he bought a home on a cruise ship because the cost of living there is much lower than living on land.</p>
<blockquote><p>Austin Wells from San Diego paid $300,000 (£246,465) for a studio with a 12-year lease onboard the MV Narrative – a mega cruise ship with 500 private rooms and apartments,</p></blockquote>
<p>a source reported.</p>
<blockquote><p>His 237 square foot entry-level room will include a foldaway bed, pantry, desk, and separate shower room.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/?attachment_id=219971" rel="attachment wp-att-219971"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-219971" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CNBC.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="791" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CNBC.jpg 960w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CNBC-300x247.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/CNBC-768x633.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></p>
<p>The 28-year-old man says he likes to travel, but he would rather not deal with the hassles of boarding flights, getting jet lag, and having his schedule thrown off. So, he decided that the best way for him to spend his time would be to buy a studio apartment on a ship so that he could sail as much as possible.</p>
<p>A source says that if Wells lives on the ship, he can save up to $500 per month and always have access to a variety of amenities, such as medical services, a gym, a private kitchen, a farmer&#8217;s market, and room service that is available 24 hours a day.</p>
<blockquote><p>The thing that most excites me is I don’t have to upend my daily routine, in order to go see the world,</p></blockquote>
<p>Austin said.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m going from this model where you want to go somewhere, you pack a bag, you get on a flight, you rent a room, to now my condo, my gym, my doctors and dentists, all of my grocery stores travel the world with me.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wells works in an area of Meta+ called Reality Labs which deals with augmented and virtual reality. He says that his job is completely remote, and he doesn&#8217;t worry about work because he just moved.</p>
<blockquote><p>My working hours will be shifted towards evenings, nights, and very early mornings. But that does open up the ability for me to … maybe see a city midday to afternoon and then start my workday around six or 7 p.m.</p></blockquote>
<p>He added by saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>This is probably the first time ever that there is even the ability to have a standard job and even consider working and living from a floating apartment complex.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the cruise ship, you can also find a school, a bank, a swimming pool, a movie theater, a whiskey bar, and a library, among many other places. The cruise ship also has close to twenty places to eat and drink.</p>
<p>The person who was born and raised in San Diego said that the average monthly rent in his hometown is $2,500 (or £2,053.88). On the other hand, if he lived on the ship, he would have to pay $2,000 (£1,643.10) each month, which is $500 less than the rent he was paying before.</p>
<p>Austin said he wanted to meet new people and make new friends while he was on board because he would be traveling a lot.</p>

<blockquote><p>We will be traveling around the world, so it’s better when you make some good friends along the way.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the source,</p>
<blockquote><p>The cruise ship will be home to around 1,000 residents when it launches in 2025.</p>
<p>A penthouse apartment on other luxury cruise ships can cost $20.5 million (£16.8 million).</p>
<p>The cruise ship will be divided into 11 different types of homes, including a Global residence, which will consist of two levels and have four bedrooms, two bathrooms, a large balcony, a dining room, and a walk-in closet.</p></blockquote>
