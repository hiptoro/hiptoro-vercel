			<p>Does this situation sound familiar?</p>
<p>You have just ordered a large bucket of fried chicken and are out in town. Every bite is better than the last. The skin is crispy, so almost every wound gets a score on the Richter scale. Your mouth and fingers are greasy and salty but you don&#8217;t care because they are so delicious.</p>
<p>But that might be better. If you made a small suggestion, it would be for more skin, less meat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Would you hold the Chicken after having all the skin you wanted?</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s like a dream. After all, how can you enjoy fried chicken skin without chicken? The two are mutually exclusive, right?</p>
<p>California food stalls make that dream come true for fried skin lovers around the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Introducing Chick N&#8217; Skin, a company that heard complaints and said, &#8220;Get all the edible fried chicken skins.&#8221;</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.insider.com/fried-chicken-skins-chick-n-skin-2019-5">Insider</a>, the company is located at 626 Night Markets in Southern California, offering hungry customers a dream gift. It is chicken skin without chicken.</p>
<p>A quick look at the company&#8217;s Instagram shows that customers can wear their favorite clothes. Salsa, cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos-this is your fried world, companion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>These delicacies are exactly what it sounds like. Imagine your favorite fried chicken without chicken.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174769" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/rdAVo6HeseK2TZMY8Qc5.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="768" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/rdAVo6HeseK2TZMY8Qc5.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/rdAVo6HeseK2TZMY8Qc5-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/rdAVo6HeseK2TZMY8Qc5-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/rdAVo6HeseK2TZMY8Qc5-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>All salty, greasy, fried delicacies can be ordered warm and enjoyed with your favorite sauce.</p>
<p>The company also offers barbecue bacon sheets and salt and vinegar sheets, but everyone knows who the real star is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Some people point out that these chicken skins are basically the best treatment for keto.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174770" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/D1Q68lM3wqM09lnehXAp.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="900" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/D1Q68lM3wqM09lnehXAp.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/D1Q68lM3wqM09lnehXAp-300x264.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/D1Q68lM3wqM09lnehXAp-768x675.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Each serving contains only 1 gram of carbohydrates. It knows that all people with ketogenic skills are within the range of a ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>Moreover, as if the whole deal wasn&#8217;t surprising enough, the company is actually reducing waste by getting chicken skin from a company that normally throws away chicken after it has been processed.</p>
<p>So, reduce, reuse, recycle and get into my stomach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>No need to fret if you won&#8217;t be in the Southern California area soon.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-174771" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mcj55bqX7brogqp4SwC1.gif" alt="" width="825" height="502" /></p>
<p>Chick N&#8217;Skin is available at other festivals and events throughout the year. Therefore, keep an eye out for the stalls that most people line up in front of.</p>
<p>Or, if you&#8217;re a little more impatient, they also offer online ordering so you can have the chicken skin delivered directly to your doorstep for $ 5.99 per bag. Check out all the flavors, including Chinese Salt &amp; Pepper, Buffalo Wings, Tom Yum (sweet and spicy).</p>
