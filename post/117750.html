			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most people who get a pet, do a lot of thinking and research before making a fur baby one of their family members. People take time to understand whether they can actually live with the dog or not. And then, they take a final decision. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But sometimes, life gets changed in just a blink of an eye. This same thing has happened with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jack Jokinen from Fishtown, Philadelphia. And it is the sweetest thing on the Internet. Scroll down to read his story. </span></p>
<h2>Recently a man named Jack Jokinen created a wholesome Twitter thread after a mystery puppy appeared in his home</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Saturday morning, Jack was </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">woken up by his wife as she saw a strange dog in their house.“When we found Suzy it was a combination of scared and confused. We had no idea how she got here and worried someone was in our house. She was scared and shaking from being wet and cold”. </span></p>
<p>Since all the doors and windows were closed, Jack and his wife were confused about how the mystery puppy come in?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After seeing the dog, Jack decided to adopt the cutie. Jack shared </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Suzy has a heart murmur, hook worn, infected paws, pad damage, and atrophy in one of the legs from it being so damaged. She needs a bunch of dental work but is very underweight so we need to get her weight up and have some tests to make sure she can be put under for procedures.”</span></p>

<p>“We decided to adopt her because she had no owner, and our first dog George has brought us so much joy, we could imagine just putting her in the system,” he said.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-117759 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/10-61.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="934" /></p>

<p>“She has been great with our family, including our baby. She is very sweet and just wants to be loved. Suzy is on the mend and getting better every day. Her body is filling out and she is on antibiotics to treat some of her problems. Shes got a long road ahead but is on the way,” Jack told us.</p>
<h2>He constantly updated people on the situation and told them that he’s adopting the puppy</h2>

<p>“The twitter thread took a life of its own. I never expected it to turn into this but Suzy is now the internets dog. People have donated about $18k towards Suzy’s medical bills. We hope they arent that high and we can take the remaining funds to donate to a worthwhile cause.”</p>
