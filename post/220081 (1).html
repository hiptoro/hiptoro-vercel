			<p>The second part of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle&#8217;s Netflix documentary series &#8220;Harry &amp; Meghan&#8221; came out on Thursday, December 15. In it, the couple made more accusations against the royal family, which the Sussexes left in 2020. In the final episode, Harry said that he and his wife Meghan were &#8220;better than those who were born to do&#8221; the royal work.</p>
<p>The Duke of Sussex is said to have said in the documentary,</p>
<blockquote><p>The issue is when someone who&#8217;s marrying in who should be a &#8216;supporting act&#8217; is then stealing the limelight or is doing the job better than those who were born to do this then upsets people &#8211; it shifts the balance.</p></blockquote>
<p>He kept talking while footage showed Kate Middleton and Prince Charles, who was then Prince Charles, going to public events.</p>
<blockquote><p>You&#8217;ve been led to believe that the only way that your charities can succeed and be grown or improved is if you&#8217;re on the front pages of those newspapers. But the media are the ones who choose who to put on the front page,</p></blockquote>
<p>he continued.</p>
<p>The father-of-two explained,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The first time the penny dropped for her, M and I spent the night in a room inÂ Buckingham PalaceÂ after an event where every single member of the Royal family &#8211; senior members of the Royal family &#8211; had been, including the Queen,</p>
<p>before Meghan chimed in,</p>
<blockquote><p>The next morning, they&#8217;d set up breakfast for Harry and I.</p></blockquote>

<p>Harry remarked,</p>
<blockquote><p>And on the front page of the Telegraph&#8230; [a picture of] Meghan,</p></blockquote>
<p>to which Meghan added,</p>
<blockquote><p>I went, oh my God.</p></blockquote>
<p>Harry then noted,</p>
<blockquote><p>She said, &#8216;But it&#8217;s not my fault&#8217;. I said, &#8216;I know. And my mum felt the same way.â€™</p></blockquote>
<p>The docuseries also showed Abigail Spencer, who worked with Meghan on the TV show &#8220;Suits.&#8221; She reportedly said,</p>
<blockquote><p>The work they were doing, the speeches, the people they were meeting, it seemed to be amazing. And then I don&#8217;t understand what happened after that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another friend of Meghan said,</p>
<blockquote><p>I think Australia was a real turning point because they were so popular. So popular with the public. The internals at the palace were incredibly threatened by that.</p></blockquote>

<p>Also, the couple&#8217;s former spokesman, James Holt, is said to have said,</p>
<blockquote><p>Some people in the institution around the family started to see that this new couple could destabilize the power dynamics. Whether actively talked about or not, the aim was to put them in a box or make them irrelevant.</p></blockquote>
<p>This wasn&#8217;t it, because Meghan also talked about her conversation with her former private secretary in the documentary series. She is said to have said that when she first joined the family, she was seen as a &#8220;foreign organism.&#8221; She said,</p>
<blockquote><p>It is like a fish that is swimming perfectly. It is powerful, it is on the right current. Then one day this little organism comes in. This foreign organism. And the entire thing goesâ€¦ &#8216;What is that? What is it doing here? It doesnâ€™t look like us. It doesnâ€™t move like us. We donâ€™t like it. Get it off of us.</p></blockquote>

<p>Meghan explained before concluding,</p>
<blockquote><p>And I was really hopeful that that was true.</p></blockquote>

<p>People don&#8217;t seem to believe the two when they say they can do the job well. As one person tweeted,</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the funniest thing I&#8217;ve ever heard.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another shared,</p>
<blockquote><p>Ok..now this is officially a comedy!</p></blockquote>
<p>The third one wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>And that is why everyone is doing so well without them? They had no impact and that gets their goat.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fourth one added,</p>
<blockquote><p>Job, is that what they call it? Only work I ever saw these two do is the con job they pulled over England and the RF.</p></blockquote>
