			<p>As technology is advancing day by day, we, the humans too are getting dependent on it. We want our groceries, essentials, and even cars and furniture at our home just on a click of a mobile button. Come on! Who would take that pain of visiting the market place and then buy those items, right? We can get all the items at home with the &#8220;hassle-free delivery option&#8221;. But, with unlimited pros, there are some cons too. We all have heard about how a scammer can fool us within seconds. And all we are left is regret. So, if you too are a techno-dependent person, go through this article carefully!</p>
<p>So, we don&#8217;t just buy things online. We even sell our second-hand products. And no doubt, we can get a good amount for something that&#8217;s useless for us. Craigslist is a perfect place where you can get a couch, a car, or literally anything. But all we need to do is beware of a scammer. We can easily get to know about a wrong business after having a single conversation with them.</p>
<p>And this is how a man beat a <a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites">Craigslist</a> scammer at his own scamming game! So scroll down and have a look at the screenshots of the whole conversation!</p>
