			<p>Giving birth to your kids and being a parent is a very difficult job. It turns your life upside down. Once you made the decision to bear a child, there&#8217;s no turning back. But the joy of becoming parents is totally different. Watching your kids grow up is worth the effort.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just humans who feel so much for their kids. Dogs feel the same. After the puppies are born, the parents have a lot of mixed emotions. But the bottom line is that they are proud of their kids. They shower their pups with love. If you ever saw a dog family posing for a picture, then you can understand the feeling. It&#8217;s the most wholesome thing ever.</p>
<p>For the ones who are still unknown with the overwhelming feeling, we have some pictures of dog parents posing with their little ones. Not to mention they look super proud of their pups. Also, in the end, you might want to scream with joy because you won&#8217;t be able to take in their cuteness.</p>
