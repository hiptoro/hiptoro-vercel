<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The same thing has happened with a cute couple who couldn&#8217;t believe how fast their </span><span style="font-weight: 400">german shepherd was growing! So all they did was document the growth of the dog from his 8th weeks to 8th months. They clicked several pictures of their dog from the time she was just a little pup. And the result literally blew their mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The couple thought of recording the growth of their fur baby when they started receiving comments about her big size. Initially, they didn&#8217;t believe it. But eventually, they realized those comments were true. </span></p>
