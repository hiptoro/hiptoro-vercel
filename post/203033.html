			<p>From lucky charms to signs of trade in a former lifetime, birthmarks have been surrounded by lore and stories for centuries. It is fun to be born with one and watch it develop over time, a symbol that is uniquely yours to keep. These little marks are not always small.</p>
<p>A baby was born with a beautiful birthmark on her face. The girl is healthy and happy, even though it caused some health concerns for her family.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the subtleties of the story, the explicitness of the skin pigmentation, and the potential impacts it will have on the young lady growing up, I might want to urge you dear readers to upvote the story, leave your contemplations underneath, and, perhaps, in the event that you&#8217;re feeling liberal, follow the maker. Much appreciated so a lot, presently we should get into it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Winry was born healthy and happy, but her face was adorned with a special birthmark.</h2>

<p>Nicole Hall turned into the cheerful and pleased mother of her little girl Winry almost 13 months prior; notwithstanding, from the subsequent, she appeared on the scene, she was clearly unique.</p>
<p>The little girl had a birthmark on her face that looked like Picasso mistook her for a canvas. The parents were alarmed by this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Nicole and her husband were concerned for the newborn girl after seeing it.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-203052" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-628b54def334f__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-628b54def334f__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-628b54def334f__700-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-628b54def334f__700-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-628b54def334f__700-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Nicole explained that they were initially confused and concerned for her safety, as neither of them had ever seen a birthmark like that.</p>
<p>“When they first handed her to me, I thought it was a bruise,” Nicole told <a href="https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/wellness/video/mom-mission-show-daughter-birthmark-beautiful-83632802" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Good Morning America</a>. “It was then quickly apparent to my husband and I that it was not a bruise. And like the name, I thought it looked a lot like a mole.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>They were reassured by the doctors that they had little to worry about.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-203051" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6-628b54e0ebad2__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6-628b54e0ebad2__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6-628b54e0ebad2__700-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6-628b54e0ebad2__700-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6-628b54e0ebad2__700-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>The baby had a birthmark called <a href="https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/conditions/congenital-melanocytic-nevi">Congenital Melanocytic Nevi</a>. It occurs in around 1 in 50,000 births and the parents don&#8217;t know about it until the baby is born.</p>
<p>Nicole told <a href="https://brightside.me/wonder-people/little-winry-was-born-with-a-rare-birthmark-and-her-mom-shows-how-beautiful-her-daughter-is-806786/?utm_source=tsp_pages&amp;utm_medium=fb_organic&amp;utm_campaign=fb_gr_brightside&amp;fbclid=IwAR0wd8FiTuk6ZKZXs-vjo3Hw4-KM9FKdJlzZ1HH_MfXeQjS5GHhGB9JdOvs" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bright Side</a> that it was a huge load off their shoulders, allowing them to relax and appreciate Winry&#8217;s arrival even more. The pair are focused on keeping their daughter healthy and making her feel good about herself.</p>
<p>“Her health and happiness are our top priority. We have to monitor her with sunscreen. I’m careful with hats and that sort of thing,” the mom said. “I know our regular dermatology appointment is probably going to be our best friend growing up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>It is estimated to occur in around 1 in 50,000 births and is mostly aesthetic, carrying the same concerns as any mole or nevi.</h2>

<h2>Asher has barely acknowledged the differences between him and her.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-203049" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-628b54d96bc77__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="600" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-628b54d96bc77__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-628b54d96bc77__700-300x257.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Their first son Asher and Winry have become very close. The little sisters would be jealous of their bond. Asher is a good brother. He gets jealous when he has to share his parents&#8217; attention, but they will become the best of friends.</p>
<p>He is unaware that there is anything different about her. She has a birthmark on her face, but it doesn&#8217;t bother him.</p>
<p>That can&#8217;t be said about some people. Since Nicole began sharing her daughter&#8217;s story on social media, the family has received a lot of negative comments. People look at Winry when they are out and about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The little girl and her parents have not received the same reaction from others.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-203047" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8-628b54e507c0e__700.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8-628b54e507c0e__700.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8-628b54e507c0e__700-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8-628b54e507c0e__700-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8-628b54e507c0e__700-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Nicole has been calm about it all. Most of their social media responses are informative and funny. They are hostile toward a child or their parents.</p>
<p>Even though they are trying to not let the negative vibes get to them, they are considering ways to protect their little girl from unfair treatment as she gets older. Nicole told us that educating Winry on kindness is one of their top priorities.</p>
<p>They are raising her to be a happy and confident woman. Nicole is certain that they will always protect and direct their daughter towards people who will treat her with kindness and respect, as she is a little bit of sunshine herself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>They are trying to stay positive, but they have to consider how to protect their little girl from unfair treatment.</h2>

<p>“She just radiates joy. She’s almost always laughing or shrieking. She is just the happiest baby I have ever seen,” her mom said. “She’s a big talker already. We haven’t got a whole lot of words out, but she tells you like it is and she’s already getting a little bit of sassiness, so I think we’re gonna have a lot on our hands.”</p>
<p>There is a river of positivity and compassion. Many people have fallen in love with the little girl.</p>
<p>“For a lot of people, this is the first time seeing a birthmark like hers and that’s part of why I enjoy sharing,” Nicole said. “This is a good conversation for parents with their children to see kids have differences, or for those parents who do have a kid that looks like Winry or has any kind of a birthmark to see their child represented.”</p>

<p>Nicole is committed to raising awareness about CMN, as well as encouraging people to celebrate diversity, stay kind to others, and appreciate the beauty in all shapes and sizes. The world tells us that we shouldn&#8217;t be happy with ourselves if we don&#8217;t fit certain beauty standards.</p>

<p>Her mom wrote in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CS-VLG7JnTW/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> post: “I want Winry to know that her CMN does not define her. While it may be a part of her that makes her unique and is the reason for this extra attention, I know it will not be the most special thing about her.”</p>
<p>“I am so excited to watch her grow and discover what those other things are – her mind, sense of humor, bravery, kindness – but whatever they are, I know there will be many things about her that are much more remarkable than a spot on her face.”</p>
