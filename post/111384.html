			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have always thought that blue is for boys and pink is for girls. Pants are for men and skirts are for women. Shoes are for males and heels are for females. But is it really true? Well, at least we don’t think so. And we also don’t think that fashion and clothes should be restricted to gender. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Guys, it’s already 2020 and if you still believe that clothes have gender, you need a life. Duh! C&#8217;mon fellas, clothes are just clothes and everybody should be free to wear anything. That’s why you see ladies in shirts and pants. And you what, they nail the look. They look super cool and super sexy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But have you ever thought about how a guy would look if he tried the same thing? Have you ever seen a guy in a short skirt and beautiful heels? If you have not, you are going to see it today. It’s because we have collected 30 pictures where a guy is perfectly proving that clothes should not be restricted based on gender. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, are you excited? Alright, then scroll down. </span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111385 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-60.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="1515" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The name of this super cool guy is Mark </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan and he is currently living in Germany. He is a robotic engineer and he wears a skirt almost every day to his work. He told us that </span>&#8220;I dress like this because I can. Just to be different. I have always admired the women that wore tight skirts and heels. Not sexually, but the power they presented. I don’t dress to be sexual, but to dress like any professional woman would. To me, clothes have no gender. I prefer skirts to dresses. Dresses don’t allow me to mix the genders. I prefer a &#8216;masculine&#8217; look above the waist and a non-gendered look below the waist. It’s all about clothes having no gender.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111386 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2-59.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we asked Mark what has inspired him to do something different and great, he said &#8220;all the fashion options. With men’s pants, you have just a few color options: black, gray, navy, and brown, and no pants with prints. With skirts, you can add reds, green, brighter blues, floral prints, animal prints, etc. Same with shoes, but then you also have many more styles and heel types. Plus you can wear open-toed shoes when the weather is nice.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111387 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-61.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I feel no different as to me, it’s just clothes. Naturally, on a cold or windy day, it physically feels different. When wearing heels, I feel taller, but also empowered for some reason. In all, maybe having the inner strength to have the confidence to wear non-conforming clothing has also given me the confidence and strength to handle my pressures at work.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111388 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/4-61.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111389 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/5-59.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="1718" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mark leads a normal life and is happily married for 11 years. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;My wife often makes suggestions on what I should wear. My daughter wishes she could borrow my shoes at times.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111390 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-60.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I am 6’ tall and weigh around 165 lbs. I also have medium to small feet. I wear a size 8.5 US and 41 in Europe. I have a 29” waist so I wear a size 8 skirt in the US or a 38 in Europe. I also work out 2-3 times a week. So finding clothes my size is no problem.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111391 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/7-59.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="1443" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111392 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-59.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I buy most of my heels online so that I can try them at home. This way I can have some shoe time and try going up and down the stairs. Feel how much they slip, the stability when testing stilettos. I’ll also wear them while sitting for half an hour or so. If they hurt right out of the box, then back in the box they go. So having a good comfortable shoe is important, but so is the style.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111393 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/9-60.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="1484" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111394 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10-59.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="1467" /></p>
<p>&#8220;My favorite is a 5-inch stiletto. I just love the way they make me look and the feeling they give. My least favorite thing is walking on uneven surfaces like a cobblestone walkway or a sidewalk with pavers that have gaps big enough to swallow a stiletto heel.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111395 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/11-58.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111396 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/12-60.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="1602" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I wear almost exclusively pencil skirts and stiletto heels. I don’t wear dresses as that is not my style, which is presenting as the man above the waist, with non-gendered clothing below the waist. I prefer my skirts at the knee plus or minus an inch or two. My average heel height for a week is around 4 inches.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111397 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/13-58.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Take a person with bright green hair. Green hair is not normal. You look up and see this person, your mind tells you it’s a person with green hair, you think to yourself, that’s odd or interesting, then you go back to do what you were doing and don’t give it another thought. I believe this is the same when people see me in a skirt and heels.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111398 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/14-59.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="880" /></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111399 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/15-55.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="1715" /></p>
<p>&#8220;If you are asking about heels, then I would say to start with a low heel and work your way up as your confidence gets higher. You cannot be afraid. Some people are like animals, they attack the weak. Show confidence and show the world you are not afraid and nobody will bother you. The only fear you have is fear itself. Skirts? Just do it. Maybe not with high heels, but skirts are much more acceptable on a man than a man wearing heels&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old girlfriend in college asked me to dance with her with us both wearing heels. We did this for more than a year. I got very good at walking and moving in heels. Throughout the years, I have worn heels off and on, but not with skirts. I just started wearing heels with skirts in the last 5 years. It was suggested that I would look a lot better in a skirt and heels than pants and heels.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111402 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/18-47.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="1581" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I am old enough to remember that in school, the girls could not wear pants. Pants have now become a non-gendered article of clothing. So why can&#8217;t skirts and heels be non-gendered? Besides, men wore heels before women did. Maybe not today’s stiletto-style heels, but men did wear heels before women.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-111403 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/19-43.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="1478" /></p>

<p>&#8220;I do this for non-sexual reasons. Men can wear this style without being labeled as gay or queer. I don’t act like a sissy, which is one of the most frequent comments I get from men. They just assume I’m gay and a sissy until they start talking to me. I am just an average, normal, straight, and happily married guy. I love beautiful women, Porsche, and I just want to incorporate a skirt and heels into my daily wardrobe.&#8221;</p>
