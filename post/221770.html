			<p>A woman went viral after saying that her beauty &#8220;intimidates people&#8221; and that other women look down on her because of it.</p>
<p>As a way to feel good, people can spend hours and a lot of money trying to look as good as possible.</p>
<p>One person doesn&#8217;t agree with the idea that being pretty is a good thing.</p>
<p>A TikTok post from more than a year ago has recently resurfaced. In it, a woman talks about beauty and how people have treated her throughout her life. Her opinion has been making waves on social media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Watch the video below to see this girl who looks like Kate Moss.</h2>

<p>Brenttany Sharraine, who is a motivational speaker and has over 16,000 Instagram followers and 167,000 TikTok followers, thinks that people treat her differently because of how she looks.</p>
<p>She also said that this kind of treatment isn&#8217;t always good, as most people would think.</p>
<p>Sharraine explained that it&#8217;s not &#8220;pretty privilege,&#8221; which is a trend in which attractive people think they are treated better because of how they look. Instead, it&#8217;s her own experiences.</p>
<p>The speaker on motivation began her TikTok with:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is just me giving you guys my experiences on how people treat me.</p>
<p>Yes, I do get a lot of stares and I get a lot of compliments too.</p>
<p>Some people gaze and some people scowl at me.</p>
<p>But what I’ve noticed is that the people who usually scowl are usually women. I have never in my life noticed a man scowling at me, so it says a lot.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sharraine went on to say that she feels like a &#8220;trophy&#8221; because her previous partners often introduced her to their friends and family early on, no matter how serious the relationship was.</p>
<p>The influencer continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve been told I come off very intimidating, although I’m not mean at all to people.</p>
<p>I’ve been invited to events and meetings with business partners.</p>
<p>I’m aware now as a woman in her late 20s that I’ve been used as a trophy before.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sharraine also said that her looks have affected the way she gets along with other women.</p>
<p>She says that women have told her that when they first met her, they thought she was a &#8220;b****.&#8221;</p>
<div style="width: 576px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-0-1" width="576" height="1024" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/‘People-Are-Intimidated-By-My-Beauty-And-I-Get-Scowls-From-Other-Women.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/‘People-Are-Intimidated-By-My-Beauty-And-I-Get-Scowls-From-Other-Women.mp4">https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/‘People-Are-Intimidated-By-My-Beauty-And-I-Get-Scowls-From-Other-Women.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>Sharraine then said that men have told her she looks &#8220;expensive&#8221; even when she&#8217;s not wearing anything expensive.</p>
<p>The motivational speaker also said that she had been left out of groups of friends, even the ones she had made herself.</p>
<p>Sharraine said at the end of the video:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was told as a child that it’s unattractive to believe that you are pretty, even if you are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though Sharraine&#8217;s TikTok has no comments, people are still talking about her video online.</p>
<p>One person wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Agreed I’ve had the worst few years because of my looks.</p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Block support and well I’ve lost friends and my life made hell! Agreed pretty privilege! No p</span><span class="r-18u37iz">retty hurts</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">!</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Someone else added:</p>
<blockquote><p>She’s right. Really stunning-looking girls do have a lot of problems with unwanted attention.</p></blockquote>
