			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever wished that your furry angel should stay a little puppy? Well, just like you, every pet parent secretly wishes that their dog must stay </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">small and pudgy forever. Unfortunately, puppyhood doesn’t last long and it seems like these cuties grow up in just a blink of an eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This thing is true especially in the case of German shepherds. But there is a special pup called Ranger would stay pup forever. We know it&#8217;s hard to believe but it is true. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He is a full grown </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3-year-old purebred German Shepherd with a rare condition, i.e., Pituitary Dwarfism. In simple terms, this dog would stay a puppy irrespective of his age. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are curious to know how he is diagnosed with dwarfism, it&#8217;s because of an infection that was caused by a parasite called Giardia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You might find him adorable but his cuteness comes with side effects. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This condition can be recessively inherited in certain breeds.</span></p>
<p>“When we originally got Ranger from the breeder, he was smaller than all his other littermates, but we figured that was because he had a parasite called Coccidia,” says Ranger’s human, Shelby Mayo.</p>

<p>“In the weeks following, we took him home and he was parasite free but later on ended up getting a parasite called Giardia. At the same time, we also discovered that Ranger had a large infection on his neck. We were eventually able to get the infection under control, fast forward a few months later we were finally able to get rid of Giardia.”</p>
