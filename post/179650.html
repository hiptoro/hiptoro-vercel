			<p>Have you seen Jay Weinstein&#8217;s work? He is an Australian photographer who loves to travel. He has been living and traveling around India since he was just three years old.</p>
<p>As he has spent a major part of his life in India, in 2013, he started a project. It was titled <em>so I asked them to smile</em> where he travels the world and photographs strangers before and after asking them to smile.</p>
<p>After his work went viral, he was interviewed by several people. There he revealed that “it forces me to challenge whatever preconceptions I have of them and learn again and again how inaccurate my assumptions are”. “Most of all, at this time of division, ‘so I asked them to smile’ stands as a profound and loving reminder of how much we all truly have in common.”</p>
<p>He has also visited countries like China, Singapore, Kenya, and Nepal. “The dream is to one day take ‘so I asked them to smile to every country on earth. Let’s see what my time, finances, and the post-COVID-19 world look like!” says Jay.</p>
<p>See some of Jay’s beautiful portraits in the gallery below!</p>
