			Lonely 90-Year-Old Woman Leaves a Heartbreaking Note On the Neighbor’s Door

			<p>Wanda, who was 90 years old at the time, said that she felt very alone and all by herself. It&#8217;s a common feeling among older people, who often outlive their friends and, in some cases, don&#8217;t even have a family to take care of them.</p>
<p>Wanda knew how much she needed to interact with other people, so she decided to take matters into her own hands. She wrote a note and stuck it to the front door of her neighbor, whose name was Marleen Brooks and who lived in San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>Wanda&#8217;s letter was a simple request that came straight from her heart.</p>
<p>The note read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Would you consider to become my friend. I’m 90 years old- live alone. All my friends have passed away. I’m so lonesome and scared. Please I pray for someone.</p></blockquote>

<p>The next night, Marleen and a friend went to Wanda&#8217;s house to introduce themselves. On that visit, she also brought cupcakes.</p>
<p>After everything was over, Marleen wrote a letter to KTVU News reporter Frank Somerville to tell him what had happened.</p>
<blockquote><p>Frank!<br />
She’s such a sweet lady!<br />
And she was over the moon when we came over.<br />
Wanda said:<br />
‘I hope you didn’t think I was stupid for writing you, but I had to do something.<br />
Thank you so much for coming over.</p>
<p>I’ve lived here for 50 years and don’t know any of my neighbors.’<br />
Wanda has 3 sons, one died last year of cancer.<br />
The other two live far away.<br />
She’s 90 and and is on oxygen and has congestive heart failure, osteoporosis, among other ailments.<br />
We brought her cupcakes (didn’t have enough time with work to make the banana bread).</p>
<p>I also made sure she knew she can call us at anytime and that I’ll be back to spend time with her!<br />
I’m sure Wanda and I will have some great times.”</p></blockquote>
<p>After Wanda told her story, dozens and dozens of people took the time to read her letter and then share it on Facebook.</p>
<blockquote><p>I love this story,</p></blockquote>
<p>Frank wrote in response.</p>
<blockquote><p>And I’m so happy for Wanda. But as I said in my first post, there are so many others out there who are lonely just like Wanda. I would ask that maybe you consider knocking on their door and saying hi. I know it would mean the world to them. And who knows, maybe you’ll make a new friend.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is great advice that you should follow. You could also consider volunteering at a senior center or an assisted living facility in your area. There are many ways to reach out and make a difference.</p>
<p>Marleen says that one reason she decided to tell her story was to remind people that there are a lot of lonely people in the world. Especially the elderly. She added,</p>
<blockquote><p>If you know someone like that in your neighborhood maybe consider going over to their home and saying hi. Maybe bring them some cookies too. I guarantee that you will make their day. But at the same time you may also make a new friend. How great would that be?</p></blockquote>
<p>People like Marleen, who go out of their way to be Wanda&#8217;s friend and spend time with her, warm our hearts. Let us know in the comments if you agree.</p>
