			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogs grow fast, they grow really fast and something it is heartbreaking. And why shouldn&#8217;t it be heartbreaking? After all, we are outliving them when we want to spend each and every moment of our lives with our furry friend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But don’t get sad because as a pet parent you can listen to them, talk with them, and play with them. And your pets deserve it because of all the unconditional love that they have showered on you over the years. Also, it is your responsibility to give the best lives to your furry friends when they need you the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting overwhelmed by all these emotions, Jessika Coker, a 28-year-old Facebook user has described everything in one of her posts that she uploaded in 2019. Jessica’s post has received a huge appreciation because other pet parents can easily relate to this thing. Currently, her post has 113K shares and 121K reactions. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessika told us &#8220;My dog Moose is growing older and I&#8217;ve noticed him start to slow down”. She also says that &#8220;As he was laying in bed with me one night, I began to cry thinking about how much my life would change without him. He has been like a shadow to me. Something you don&#8217;t notice every moment, but is always quietly there on your heels.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;He has been with me my entire adult life. When I was learning how to be alone, he was there so I didn’t have to be. When writing down my thoughts, the words just flowed out of me as I truly do cherish him and everything he has gone through with me over the years. It seems odd to think that there will be a time that he will not be there for a major event in my life as he has been for all of the others.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once Jessika’s post went viral, other pet parents have also shared their stories.</span></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101247 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-4-63.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="875" /> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101248 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-5-57.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" /></p>
<p>Fletcher was by my side through 3 homes, 3 other dogs, my wedding, deaths of dear friends and family members, a human brother, and every anxiety attack that ever crossed through my body. We said our final goodbye in April 2018. He was 18. I miss him so much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessika met her dog Moose 10 years ago when he was just a pup. She says that &#8220;I got him the day I graduated high school. I found him at a vet&#8217;s office I had been volunteering for. He was brought in and surrendered with all of his brothers and sisters and he just pulled at my heart. He was the only puppy that cared to come to me and when I would put him back with his siblings, he would cry wanting to come back out with me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>My Sofia will be 17 on Sat. You don’t realize that there will be so many lasts-last walks, last time she’s able to walk up the stairs or jump off the couch. We adapt but watching her hurt, seeing her personality fade. It’s so hard. I appreciate every day I have with her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessika still remembers the time when Moose was just a little pup and how excited she used to be everything to meet him. She says that “Moose has always been a calm spirit. He is almost like a quiet guardian of our home,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;He is the most gentle dog I have ever met and as the years with him progressed, I began to bring more animals home as it slowly turned into a wildlife sanctuary. He has become a rock for all of the animals who are shy and scared. They bond with him and as long as he is around, they have the confidence to do as they please instead of hiding in fear.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>A Saint Bernards life expectancy is 8 to 10 years. Belle is almost 12 every day with her is a blessing! She had surgery 4 years ago and they told me she maybe had a year left! I cherish every moment with my girl!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessika’s love for animals began when she was just a child. This was because she has no friends to play with. So she would stay for hours in the woods and spend time with her family dogs. She says “When I moved to Florida a few years ago, I didn’t know anyone and it felt like my childhood all over again where my dog was my constant companion”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jessika has also shared her thoughts on how she felt when Moose started growing old on Juniper Fox. It is a page that is dedicated to Elmwood, Juniper, and Fig- three North American red foxes who are currently living in a rescued house. &#8220;They were each born in captivity and are descended from fur-farm foxes. Because of their genetic differences from their wild counterparts, they cannot be released into the wild, but live happy, full lives with their loving adoptive family and their doggo brothers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She further says that other people also have a similar experience with their furry friends. She says &#8220;I think most of us who have had pets know the feeling. We all explore the thought that one day they will not be with us and that we will have to bear that grief. My post was meant to be a reminder that each day with them is special because we never know how few of those days we truly have”.</span></p>

<p>Absolutely correct. Chappy is 13.5 and now totally deaf. I&#8217;m so glad I taught him hand signals along with the voice. He understands things anyhow. Almost instinctively knows what I want and I know what he wants because so many things became routine for him. If I spin around, he knows it&#8217;s dance time. Don&#8217;t even want to imagine life without him. He&#8217;s traveled around the country with me, went to college with me, and most recently licks the tears from my face that I shed from losing my son and snuggles with me. They are a great comforter. They are special!!</p>

<p>This is my Hank.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know exactly how old he is because he was a middle of the road rescue.</p>
<p>He was starved and abused to the point that my vet said the best he could do age-wise was a guess.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s somewhere between 4 and 8 years old.</p>
<p>I saved him a few months after my husband died.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s been saving me ever since.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be his mom 3 and a half years this June.</p>
<p>I hope they&#8217;ve been the best years of his life</p>

<p>My granddog, Rocky, passed away this morning. He was a shelter rescue in Michigan and the sweetest little guy. We are all heartbroken</p>

<p>My old lady just turned 17, and I could swear I just got her a couple of years ago. The years&#8230;they go fast. She&#8217;s seen me through relationships, apartments, our house (which I bought so she could have a yard), and everything from my late twenties to mid-forties. I don&#8217;t know what my life will look like when she&#8217;s gone, but until then, I&#8217;m loving her pretty hard</p>

<p>My Harley. Got him as a rescue when he was 1. Just turned 12. He&#8217;s doing pretty good for an a old man. But, we know he only has a few more years, so we&#8217;re making the best of it.</p>

<p>This was Roxy on her last day. She was surrounded by her pack. It&#8217;s wild to me how dogs just know when it&#8217;s the end. She was 15 died two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Bailey (Bails) was rescued from an abusive household. She was the first dog I ever had and a surprise birthday present from my dad. She was so gentle and kept to herself most of the time till I brought milo (rescue pup) home and I got to see her be a puppy with him. I have her to thank for shaping milo into the pup he is today. The day she passed away, milo mooped and whined the entire day. We both miss her so much. It’ll be 2 years this April</p>

<p>Love this. Could not be more true. This is my 12-year-old baby, Belle. Just found out that she has a lung tumor, so I am cherishing every day!</p>

<p>Andre will be 16 years old in April and I&#8217;ve had him since I was 15. This really touched me because I&#8217;ve had him now for half of my life and he&#8217;s been there with me before, during, and after everything and everyone. I know that day is coming and that I&#8217;ll never be fully ready for it but I&#8217;m so thankful for how he always stayed by my side and loved me through it all</p>
<h2>#20<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101267 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-24-15.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="809" /></h2>
<p>It&#8217;s true. This girl turned 9 years old last month. I adopted her as a 7-week old puppy when my firstborn was 4 months old and my husband was deployed. She&#8217;s been by my side more than anyone else, literally. She&#8217;s having mobility issues now due to hip dysplasia and arthritis and it absolutely kills me to think she won&#8217;t be around much longer.</p>
<h2>#21<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101268 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-25-13.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" /></h2>
<p>Our first baby, she&#8217;ll be 10 in a few weeks. She picked my husband all those years ago. She has dementia and forgets where she is and who we are sometimes but she still gives great snuggles</p>
<h2>#22<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101269 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-26-11.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" /></h2>
<p>This touches right on spot. 11 years before I can blink. Love my old lady</p>
<p>House won&#8217;t be the same without her</p>

<p>My baby girl lived almost 14 1/2 years. I miss her every day.</p>

<p>11 in June. Been there by my side through so many things. He got sick a few months ago and gave us a scare. I love having so many years with him but hate watching him age. He needs a pause button. He&#8217;s a forever dog. I don&#8217;t want to ever have to say goodbye</p>
<h2>#25<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101272 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-29-5.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1445" /></h2>
<p>I miss my Basset Hound Chelsea so much. She passed away a year ago this month from dementia. She was my life</p>

<p>This rings so true to me, I lost my gorgeous lab maxi nearly a year ago to the day. I’m so lucky to have a fantastic back girl in my life who lets me share in time with her gorgeous hound too.</p>
<h2>#27<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101274 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-31-3.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="941" /></h2>
<p>My poor baby girl is coming up on 15 yrs now and I haven&#8217;t got to see her in 2 yrs last I saw her she was starting to go blind and was having a hard time getting around my dad&#8217;s yard sadly I&#8217;m just waiting g to hear them tell me she passed. My older lab Sam passed away 2 years ago after 15 yrs of being in my life. I miss them both dearly</p>
<h2>#28<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101275 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-32-2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="933" />My Lucy girl. She is 7. She was my first baby before my human ones I dread her last day.</h2>
<h2>#29<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101276 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-33-2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="521" /></h2>
<p>This one will be eight in May. Had her since she was weeks old, not ready for her to get old! She is absolutely family and her and her little sister are very loved</p>
<h2>#30<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101277 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-34-2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1244" /></h2>
<p>And once you&#8217;ve lost your heart dog you&#8217;ll never be the same. You&#8217;ll never feel the same pure joy with your other pets. Because the memory of what it feels like to lose them will always be in the back of your mind</p>
<p>P.S. Don&#8217;t cry!</p>
