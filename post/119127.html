			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we were kids, we used to watch a lot of cartoon shows. But honestly, we don‚Äôt even remember a few of them as we grew up. However, there are also a few shows that refuse to leave our memory. There are a few cartoon characters that we are still in love with. And when we are talking about funny and weird shows, how can we not mention </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jim Henson&#8217;s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dinosaurs?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This show was funny, it was cute, and above all, we are totally in love with Sinclair family. Didn‚Äôt we? Of course, we were! That‚Äôs why we couldn‚Äôt keep calm when we came to know that this show is coming again on Disney+. (We are not crying, you are crying)</span></p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-3ad8d2a9=""><i>Dinosaurs</i>¬†ran from 1991-1994.</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This cute show was just like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roseanne</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> met </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Muppets.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surely, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dinosaurs</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ran only for a short period of time on television but people are totally in love with it. In just a short span of time, this cartoon show has made millions of fans. (You would be lying if you say that you didn‚Äôt like this show)</span></p>
<h2 class="headline" data-v-3ad8d2a9="">The show might&#8217;ve looked silly, but it covered a lot of deep topics, especially for airing in the &#8217;90s!</h2>
