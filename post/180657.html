			20 Americans Share A List of Reasons Why They Chose To Leave Their Country For Good

			<p>There is barely anyone in the world who would deny living in the United States of America. It is the most progressing and economically stable country globally. But they say, what looks attractive on the outside, isn&#8217;t always great from the inside. Well, unless you have lived in America, you don&#8217;t know the downsides of living in the country.</p>
<p>Recently, some American residents started to share their reasons for leaving their country on Reddit, and soon many came forwards to share their experiences as well. Some of the reasons that were started on the subreddit blew our minds. If you want to find out what lead these people to give up their own country and move to European countries, scroll down to read their experiences.</p>

Fear of losing my job or getting sick and getting in over my head with expenses. Fear of getting shot. Fear of getting covid due to lax regulations. Fear of getting hurt by a radicalized anti-vaxer. Fear of losing access to civil rights protection (ahem, Texas). Fear of the out of control housing market. Fear of the ramifications of our own civic, economic, and social policies. Fear I’ll finally give in to the despair. Our way of life is… it’s so completely irrational. And it’s seemingly inescapable. I think about this every day. And generally speaking, I align with contemporary European values more so than contemporary American values (are these even a thing? What are contemporary American values?) Education, culture, a well-rounded life fully lived, travel, prioritizing social good over economic growth. These are the things that I want for myself and everyone. I’ve lived in the US all my life. There are so many things I love about it. Truly. But the older I get, the more it feels like a trap. A trap with a really effective marketing campaign.”</figcaption></figure>

We were both working extremely long hours in the US and it was killing us. We were both making a lot of money, but it was coming at too great a cost. There’s also the political and social situation. Society is extremely polarized in the U.S. Now, we have six weeks of vacation, guaranteed healthcare, and a political system that isn’t a complete sh*tshow 24/7. There are also a lot more opportunities here. America is actually extremely toxic for non-unicorn small businesses, so industries are getting consolidated into fewer and fewer firms. Stockholm is internationally known as a tech hub, but unlike the Bay area you can actually afford to buy a house here. Hell, for 18 months we were living comfortably on a single income, which would be impossible in the states. We don’t ever want to move back. Hopefully we’ll be able to get our citizenship in 3 more years and we’ll never have to.”</figcaption></figure>

Live a lifestyle that was once considered the American dream. I important distinction is that we/I found that life was more basic here. Less materialistic. People still have gardens, walk to places they want to go. Christmas is about family and not about how many gifts you got. I just find it to be a more sustainable environment for my family.”</figcaption></figure>

As much as I deeply love and miss the US — the nature, the food, friends, the VIBE — I have no plans to move back. Healthcare in America scares the bejeesus out of me, especially as I age. I just had surgery on an injury that cost me nothing — I still feel like I’m getting away with murder. And the work-life balance is so insane once you see it from the outside. I stopped being able to understand how my mom was slaving away for a company that really didn’t pay much for 2 precious weeks of paid vacation a year (and I would describe my family as privileged). COVID really changed my view, seeing everyone in my city dutifully wear the mask even after it’s not required, whereas my state in America devolved into a culture war. “Devolving” is, unfortunately, the best word I have to describe the US in the last decade(s).”</figcaption></figure>

I don’t regret it and can’t ever see myself moving back to the US. A couple of my friends are still trying to figure out ways to move over where. Just a few things off the top of my head regarding why: 5 weeks of paid vacation up to 2 years of paid parental leave (including for dads as well) no such thing as a copay at the doctor price cap on prescription drugs (like EUR 6) low crime rate more well developed social safety net (ie. less poverty) I once spent 10 days in the hospital and needed emergency surgery.

I know that exists in Europe but there still seems to be more appreciation for the slow life. That plus being able to walk more and use public transport, long vacations, better social safety nets…I just feel happier and healthier with that lifestyle.”</figcaption></figure>

I was mentally tired from living in a state of near catastrophe all the time. I had a good job but one medical catastrophe (of which I’d already had a few) could have bankrupted me. I wanted kids but again, it’s one catastrophe away from homelessness WITH kids. And no social support for kids either, like parental leave after the birth, subsidized childcare, subsidized higher education. I hated never having job security despite being excellent at my job. Basically everything about all of the systems in the US terrified me. My quality of life is incalculably improved by living in a country that cares about its citizens.”</figcaption></figure>
