			<p>You&#8217;ll observe that the best things you experience in life are not those that you can buy with money. A act of kindness was recently shared on the Internet when a stranger got viral for his humble act. She did not even think about her decision twice, but it did mean everything for little someone else.</p>
<p>The incident occurred during a sports game when a little boy named Isaiah Miller was wandering in the bleachers and met with a stranger named Angela. The body came and sat on her lap and they had a little chat after which she left. This quick interaction between the boy and the lady created a lasting impact on the body and his family, but no one really thought that it could have a lasting impact on Isaiah.</p>
<p>Just two weeks after this first interaction, Angela and Isaiah were both back at a game in the stadium, and Isaiah took no time to spot his new friend.</p>
<p>“Isaiah walked right up to her smiling, crawled in her lap and laid his head down on her shoulder,” Star Balloon-Bradley, Isaiah’s aunt, recalled on her now-viral Facebook post. “She welcomed him with open arms. This lady patted and rocked Isaiah to sleep like he had given birth to him. It was the sweetest!”</p>
<p>In her post, she shared some pictures of Isaiah snuggling up to Angela (who Star refers to as “Mrs. Angela”) on the bleachers.</p>

<p>“Isaiah can come across shy at first, but some people he immediately warms up to, and Mrs. Angela During is one of those persons,” Isaiah’s mom, Thameka Miller, said. “He can discern if a person needs a hug, and he loves elderly people.”</p>
<div class="ad_ph"></div>
<p>Star repeatedly apologized to Angela and checking with her if Isaiah was “bothering” her, and that it was totally fine if she is not comfortable entertaining him, but Angela was very generous, saying he wasn’t bothering her at all.</p>
<div class="ad_ph"></div>
<p>She was happy to cuddle the little boy and, and loved every second of it. She also has 15-year-old of her own, and now she doesn&#8217;t get to share such moments with her son.</p>
<div class="ad_ph">
<p>Star’s post has been shared almost 350,000 times and has over one million likes. And Star thinks she knows why it’s gaining so much attention.</p>
<div class="ad_ph"></div>
<p>“With all of the racial tension that’s going on I’m glad to see the pictures like these because it goes to show color don’t matter to a lot of people,” Star stated in her post “Arguing over stuff as such makes us miss the simple pleasures in life.”</p>
<div class="ad_ph"></div>
<p>Thameka shared her views regarding the post, saying that she thinks the post became viral and got lots of love because people felt emotional about how the race was no boundary for them to have a special bond, especially through the eyes of a child.</p>
<div class="ad_ph"></div>
<p>“I think with the racial tension that has manifested lately this story helps to restore hope in humanity and it shows the power of love,” Thameka said. “Also the innocence of a child and how love has no color boundaries.”</p>
<div class="ad_ph"></div>
<p>As for Angela, As soon as she noticed that Star posted the photos about her, she couldn’t help recall how blessed she herself felt. “I am humbled by the kind words every one has spoken. Isaiah is absolutely adorable! I pray people will Jesus in all this &amp; know His love is beyond measure &amp; that is how I want to love &amp; life my life. I’m not worthy but He sure is!”</p>
<div class="ad_ph"></div>
