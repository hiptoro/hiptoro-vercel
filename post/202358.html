			<p>A 98-year-old woman moved in to be with her son. In 2016 Tom Keating moved into a care home. His mother followed after the move because she was worried about his well-being.</p>

<p>Tom needed his mother to be with him and she wanted to be with him. The two are happy in the same care home.</p>
<p>While speaking to the Liverpool Echo, Ada said, “I say goodnight to Tom in his room every night and I’ll go and say good morning to him. I’ll tell him I’m coming down for breakfast. When I go out to the hairdressers he’ll look for me to see when I’m coming back. When I get back he’ll come to me with his arms outstretched and give me a big hug. You never stop being a mum!”</p>
<p>When Tom was asked about how his mother’s move made him feel, he said: “They’re very good here and I’m happy to see my mum more now she lives here. She’s very good at looking after me. Sometimes she’ll say ‘Behave yourself!”</p>
<p>Four children were left behind by the death of their father. Janet was one of her daughters. Barbara and Margi are Tom&#8217;s sisters. Along with their families, they visit their mother and brother at the care home.</p>

<p>Among the regular visitors of the family are a granddaughter and a granddaughter. Debi spoke about Tom and Ada, “There’s no parting them!” “It’s reassuring for us that they’re both getting looked after 24/7.”</p>
<p>Mr. Philip Daniels is the manager at Moss View, and he also spoke about Tom and Ada, “It’s very touching to see the close relationship both Tom and Ada share, and we are so pleased we were able to accommodate both of their needs,” “It’s very rare to see mothers and their children together in the same care home and we certainly want to make their time together as special as possible. They are inseparable.”</p>
<p>This story brought tears to our eyes. The mother&#8217;s love for her son is amazing. We should care for mothers for as long as they are around us.</p>
