			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the springtime Lake Michigan is becoming one of the most photogenic lakes. The long cold winter influenced by the Polar Vortex, which is a band of strong winds that keep the Arctic region bitterly cold causes the transformation of the lake. The Polar Vortex can even influence the weather in the areas of North America and brings freezing temperatures down to record-breaking lows of -30 ° C (-23 ° F).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it happens,</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> the waves form hills of ice resulting in ice shelves. Finally, when spring arrives, the lake transforms into majestic heaven by melting ice. The dynamic water underneath the melting ice pushes shelves to the surface and results in a fascinating phenomenon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This mesmerizing pattern has been captured by photographers for years. They are always warned by the American coast guards to only admire the magical ice from afar, because of the melting ice, which causes a dangerous surface to walk on. </span><span style="font-weight: 400"> “No ice is safe ice, especially this time of year,” said Grant Heffner of the US Coast Guard BMC. “The ice is certainly deteriorating and breaking up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The number of citizens around the shores of Lake Michigan, mainly in the big cities Chicago and Milwaukee increased rapidly and now there are almost 12 million people. It is interesting to mention that this hasn’t always been the case. The first habitants of this area were the Hopewell-Indians. Their culture existed from around 800 AD when the area mingled with the Late Woodland Indians for the next few hundred years.</span><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-194946 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/3-36.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="587" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lake Michigan is the biggest lake in North America that lies entirely within the United States. It is part of the five Great Lakes of North America and it’s the second biggest by volume (4,900 km3 or 1,180 cu mi). After Lake Superior and Lake Huron, it’s the largest by surface area (58,030 km2 or 22,404 sq mi).</span></p>
