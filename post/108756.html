<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Many have this misconception that dogs originated from wolves, but that is false.

It is just a wild guess, but breeders do not stop at experimenting with different dog breeds. It has led to dogs being available in different shape, size colour and features.

</div>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-108759 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3-131.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="546" /> Dogs have a second nose it is vomeronasal organ also called Jacobson’s Organ.

</div>
<p data-wp-editing="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-108764 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/8-123.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="546" /> Domesticated dogs usually sleep belly-up when they feel safe around their master. If your pet is not sleeping in this position, don&#8217;t be disappointed. It does not have to do anything with safety, but it is their personal choice.</p>
<div class="_2r__xiKDurulGZmkq4_dl">

<p data-wp-editing="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-108765 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9-123.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="522" /> Scientific studies say that a dog never feels guilty. It is just that they have learnt making the &#8220;I am sorry face&#8221;, over time whenever you scold them. They know that this look would melt your heart instantly.</p>
<div class="_2r__xiKDurulGZmkq4_dl">
