<p>The boy&#8217;s father, Tim Arthur, luckily heard his screams and dove into the ocean to save him. Tim furiously kicked and punched the shark until he finally hit the shark hard in the nose, and it released its grasp on his son’s leg.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nick recounted the terrifying story in an interview with ABC. “The pressure was so intense,” he said of the shark’s bite. “I was trying to pry its mouth open,” he recalled.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Here is the video of the story:</h3>

<p>The family, who were visiting the Outer Banks from Oak Ridge, recounted the horrifying ordeal in an interview with <a class="class" href="https://myfox8.com/news/oak-ridge-teenager-bitten-by-shark-at-cape-hatteras/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">FOX8 </a>on Friday.</p>

<p>Amazingly, the teen was in good spirits during the interview! He said, with a smile, “I tried lifting my leg up out of the water and I saw, oh my god, it’s a 5-foot-long shark attached to my leg.” It sounds like an absolutely frightening ordeal that could’ve even been fatal. Luckily, his father was there to come to his rescue.</p>
