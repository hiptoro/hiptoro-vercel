<figure id="attachment_137026" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-137026" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-137026 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1-163.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="698" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-137026" class="wp-caption-text">Let me tell you a story about the nurse who treated me like a human being and how that made all the difference for me. When I was homeless on 103rd st and addicted to heroin, I overdosed and died. I woke up in the Park West ER with this nurse holding my hand. I was scared and alone and he spent the next couple of hours holding my hand and letting me cry with him. Every time I ended up with MRSA raging in my limbs from infections I gave myself from shooting up, he always happened to be my nurse and would help me. And finally on April 1st, the day I went to detox I went to a completely different hospital and he was there. He wasn’t my nurse but saw my name on the board and remembered me. He came in, gave me a hug, and wished me luck on my journey to rehab. I’ve wanted since I’ve gotten clean to tell him the impact he had on me. Every other nurse had always treated me like scum and the junkie that I was because they knew I was just gonna go back out again anyway. He didn’t. He took time out of his busy schedule and made me feel like a person. He held my hand. He talked to me. And he helped me. Today I went back and found him. He’s a manager now which he totally deserves. And nothing made me happier than to thank him for saving my life and for the kindness he showed me in a really dark time in my life. So thank you, Ali Fares. Hospitals need more people like you. Congratulations on your promotion. You most definitely deserved it. And if you’re reading this and you are wondering how you can help, just treat people like human beings</figcaption></figure>

The next time you look at an “addict,” “druggie,” or “junkie,” try seeing a human being instead. You’d be surprised how much showing a little compassion can help someone else.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Addict’s Diary’ project was founded by Kevin Alter. He struggled with substance abuse for more than a decade. From the age of 17 till the age of 27 it was a tough time for him to deal with it. “When I got clean, I noticed that there was a general misconception of the addict. I wanted to change that, so I did my best to humanize addiction,” Kevin explains on his website.</p>
<p>“I wanted people to see us for who we really are. The good, the bad, and the ugly. I wanted to break the stigma, inspire people, educate students, and save lives all with the stroke of a keyboard.”</p>
<p>So Kevin made a decision to take the reader along with him on his journey. “I put my all into it and it worked. Yes, I have been a client at over 29 inpatient treatment centers in my life.”</p>
