			<p>When you finally decide to quit your job, what do you have to worry about? Want to take out your frustration by doing something that totally overboard? Who cares? What can they now do to cause you harm? Fire you? They wish..</p>
<p>Here is the new list of people who just did. They created memes, shared their experiences, and pictures tell us what is the best way to possibly say goodbye to a toxic workplace and a sucked up job. Scroll down to take a look at these classic examples, and you might get some inspiration.</p>
<h2 id="post0" class="open-list-header">#1 My Boss&#8217;s Secretary Quit This Morning After Delivering Breakfast</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182467 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-78.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-78.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/1-78-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>To get more insight on quits, we reached out Germany-based personal growth and career coach Trish Lee.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are numerous reasons why a person should consider leaving their job,&#8221; Lee, who also creates content for Social media platforms like Twitter, YouTube, Facebook told Hiptoro. &#8220;For example, if they are surrounded by toxic colleagues (and they&#8217;ve tried to improve the situation by talking to their manager or said colleague but nothing changes), the company provides no continuous personal development opportunities, or their job isn&#8217;t even something they want to do—maybe they got into it just to live someone else&#8217;s dream. Or maybe they&#8217;re offered a great long-term career opportunity elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="post1" class="open-list-header">#2 Quit Your Job Like A Boss</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182468 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-78.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-78.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-78-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-78-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-78-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2 id="post2" class="open-list-header">#3 I Helped A Work Mate With His Resignation Letter. Not Sure Why He Didn&#8217;t Use It?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182469 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-76.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="856" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-76.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/3-76-245x300.jpg 245w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2 id="post3" class="open-list-header">#4 My Boss Volunteered Me For A Golf Event That I Hated Every Second Of, So I Gave Her A Golf Themed Resignation Letter</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182470 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-74.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-74.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/4-74-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t sure about quitting your job, Lee said it would be best for you to start by simply considering the pros and cons of staying vs. leaving. &#8220;You can even write everything down on paper or an Excel sheet for better clarity!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Try to do some background checks on the new company if it fits your personal growth needs, financial needs, technical skills, future career goals, company culture (check reviews on Glassdoor, Kununu, and Google),&#8221; the career coach suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;If still in doubt, accept the invitation to go for an interview (for this, it&#8217;s important to have a list of questions ready!). Clarify any doubts you may have about the new job or company background.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lee also pointed out that going for a job interview doesn&#8217;t automatically mean that you have agreed to the offer but it can provide valuable information and make your decision a lot easier. &#8220;It is just an opportunity for you to have a deeper understanding of the job and whether it suits you, while it gives the recruiter a chance to get to know you better if you suit the job—think of it like going for a first date! It doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re gonna get married.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="post4" class="open-list-header">#5 Throwback To 2018 When I Quit My Job Of 8 Years By Leaving This On My Boss&#8217;s Desk</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182471 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5-73.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5-73.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/5-73-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2 id="post5" class="open-list-header">#6 Resigning From A Bad Job With Style</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-182473 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-73.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="664" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-73.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6-73-300x285.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>He also advised that when you have faith in what you do and trust your capabilities, you shouldn&#8217;t be afraid to quit your toxic job. There will be ample opportunities that will come in your direction, so you must not fear unemployment.</p>
<p>But with that being said, Lee doesn&#8217;t really believe that quitting your job on the spot is a smart move. &#8220;If you resign too soon but, for example, haven&#8217;t got sufficient savings to tide you over the next few weeks or months until you find a new job, you are putting yourself in unnecessary stress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The interview process (from application to the actual interviews to signing a contract) can potentially take months in some companies!&#8221;</p>
<p>Unless, of course, you&#8217;re in a really bad situation, like &#8220;the VP of your company or colleagues are sexually harassing you or bullying you in some horrible way. Which by the way, please report it to the police and consider sharing your experience online (Glassdoor, Kununu, and Google).&#8221;</p>

<p>At the end of the day, trust your gut. &#8220;Doing a job because of the salary is a good form of extrinsic motivation, but it can never give you true happiness and a sense of purpose,&#8221; Lee said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When selecting a job, it is important to do something that gives your life meaning and joy (this is how intrinsic motivation and a sense of fulfillment is created). It really doesn&#8217;t matter if that means being a bartender, a cashier, a hairdresser, an entrepreneur, an engineer, whatever. Your position or salary does not equate to your self-worth. This is a misconception many people have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Your aim, according to Lee, should be to find a workplace where you get 80% satisfaction and happiness, leaving the rest 20% for possible minor inconveniences. Further, the adjustment relies on you and your employer to build a long-term relationship.</p>
<p>We hope that these images inspire you to put your papers in a toxic workplace and find a suitable and respectful environment to work in, in the future.</p>
