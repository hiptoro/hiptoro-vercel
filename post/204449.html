			<p>What is the worst kind of group to serve? A children&#8217;s soccer team? A bunch of rich businessmen? Maybe a school field trip?</p>
<p>The worst group according to one server is the post-church crowd. He shared his thoughts on TikTok, sparking up an interesting discussion, and many other servers showed up with their own horror stories as well.</p>

<h2>It&#8217;s bound to get people hungry when they&#8217;re in church.</h2>

<p>Most religious people don&#8217;t make up a full Sunday breakfast before they go to church so going out for a post-church lunch is an old tradition.</p>
<p>The trouble begins once this crowd goes out for their post-worship eats, according to one server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>They&#8217;re the worst humans on the planet.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-204454" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/88defc5a-1d49-4f1a-9f0a-130aa4773dc6.jpeg" alt="" width="508" height="556" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/88defc5a-1d49-4f1a-9f0a-130aa4773dc6.jpeg 508w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/88defc5a-1d49-4f1a-9f0a-130aa4773dc6-274x300.jpeg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /></p>
<p>The TikToker is coming in hot with the takes in his video and doesn&#8217;t let up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sundays were always the worst in the diner, not because of the sheer amount of people that show up for, like, Sunday brunch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the sheer amount of people that show up after church because they&#8217;re the worst human beings on Earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Attempting to change his mind.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-204453" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fef8d813-37d6-404b-97da-53d6c59a0008.jpeg" alt="" width="508" height="808" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fef8d813-37d6-404b-97da-53d6c59a0008.jpeg 508w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/fef8d813-37d6-404b-97da-53d6c59a0008-189x300.jpeg 189w" sizes="(max-width: 508px) 100vw, 508px" /></p>
<p>The challenge was issued over the video of him grabbing a stack of cups. You won&#8217;t change his mind about the Sunday after-church crowd being the worst.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">Commenters agreed.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-204452" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1b4bfee0-6131-4788-b9df-bf1b2499b1bb.jpeg" alt="" width="443" height="308" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1b4bfee0-6131-4788-b9df-bf1b2499b1bb.jpeg 443w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1b4bfee0-6131-4788-b9df-bf1b2499b1bb-300x209.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /></p>
<p>I was expecting some level of resistance in the comments section, but all of the top-level comments seemed to agree with the assessment. On Sundays, past and present servers let off steam by sharing their experiences with the crowd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Has anyone else received those tips?</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-204451" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f4ccdf1b-3b12-4f1c-8ea6-2ce4ba35efb4.jpeg" alt="" width="449" height="391" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f4ccdf1b-3b12-4f1c-8ea6-2ce4ba35efb4.jpeg 449w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/f4ccdf1b-3b12-4f1c-8ea6-2ce4ba35efb4-300x261.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" /></p>
<p>I used to work at a coffee shop and would sometimes receive tips. One corner is always folded over. You open it and realize that it&#8217;s a religious pamphlet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He uploaded another video.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-204450" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/e2bb6d47-e583-439d-9ff5-6a5f8c7b052e.jpeg" alt="" width="503" height="649" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/e2bb6d47-e583-439d-9ff5-6a5f8c7b052e.jpeg 503w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/e2bb6d47-e583-439d-9ff5-6a5f8c7b052e-233x300.jpeg 233w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px" /></p>
<p>A church lady made a big scene because she was told there would be a wait for a table if she didn&#8217;t make a reservation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">Do you agree?</h2>
<p>When it comes to something like this, it&#8217;s a situation where there&#8217;s smoke and fire. The video doesn&#8217;t condemn every person of faith, but it does talk about what it&#8217;s like to work in the service industry on Sundays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>We&#8217;re here to hear the stories.</h2>
<p>We have our popcorn here for the stories and any drama that might arise in the comments section. There hasn&#8217;t been much drama tied to the videos so far, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the stories aren&#8217;t engaging. You can share your thoughts in the comments section after watching the videos.</p>
