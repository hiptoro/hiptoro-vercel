			<p>Family time should be spent frequently to keep the bond between the members strong. A family photo shoot is not just about capturing pictures. The time you spend helping each other in changing costumes, eating lunch, and exploring places are what you can say is quality time.</p>
<p>A few days ago, photographer and labor and delivery nurse Tiffany Renfroe shared few images on the Internet. The theme of the shoot was Halloween and featured her husband and daughter.<br />
Taking to us she shared, &#8220;Daniel and I are very sarcastic, as people, as parents. Life is too short to take everything so seriously,”</p>
<p>“Our babies (Kaiden-10, Gibson-5, Oakley-11 months) are our world. We are active parents that would rather be doing things with them or giving them experiences over gifts or money, although they still are spoiled. Our kids go everywhere with us and are included in everything we do (we live away from family due to jobs).”</p>

<p>Tiffany’s husband, Daniel, is a Contracted Blackhawk Technical inspector and has always been a big fan of classic horror movies. “Our daughter Kaiden and he started watching The Walking Dead, waiting day by day for the next season. It’s their thing,” the mom explained. “They also watch a lot of classic horror movies, even Gibson at 5. As long as he isn’t violent, I don’t really care, he isn’t scared and isn’t traumatized by them.”</p>
<p>She said their kids know that the people and things on the screen aren’t real. “I didn’t particularly want the kids watching horror movies because they would be scared. But they aren’t. They sit there picking out different artistic stuff and laughing at the ridiculous props, makeup, and costumes used in the old classics! It wasn’t hurting them, making them scared, so whatever. It’s us. My kids are sweet and loving, do great in school, are nonviolent, love others, and that’s all that matters to us as parents.”</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-112550 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/6-94.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></p>

<p>“So I took the baby, Oakley, to visit family in Oregon — my home state — that hadn’t met her yet. While there, my best friend took some pictures of her and me for a little mommy-daughter shoot. My husband being funny when I got home said in the whiniest voice, ‘I didn’t get any daddy and daughter shoot.’ So my mind went to thinking. In the meantime, I had been tagged in some horror-themed pictures, saying it was right up my alley. Daniel gets tagged in every Michael Myers video on the net because he wears his mask all the time being funny. I wanted an original photoshoot idea, something unique.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-112552 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8-92.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="466" /></p>

<p>“Then, after a few good draft beers, it came to me, the light flickered in my head!” Tiffany said. “I would combine the ideas that Daniel loves and Kaiden loves, and do a zombie baby shoot. I honestly threw in the Michael Myers idea because I knew that would make Daniel super pumped about it. So it took me about a week to put everything together, ideas, location (we drove around for days on our side by side looking for a spot) which the kids always love, and, of course, the zombie costumes.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-112554 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10-88.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1053" /></p>

<p>“So I would do some of Daniel’s, then smudge a little on her, do a little more of his and smudge again on hers, brushes on him brushes on her, she was even attempting to help with the makeup brushes! Her sister would tickle her with the “dirt brush”. It was a game for her! About a 2-hour game. It took patience but was fun. There was no getting her to stay still like many online people have wondered how I did, I worked in her world and made it fun, you know, the tricks moms know how to pull when they need or want things done.”</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-112558 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/14-90.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="901" /></p>

<p>Even though it was an undead photoshoot, it immediately came to life, with Kaiden and Gibson helping behind the scene, Oakley learning and being so proud of herself, all of them snacking on the props, mostly the red velvet, laughing and giggling at the faces Daniel and Oakley were making. The family was also exploring the woods, watching wildlife, and riding down country roads on their side by side. “It was much more than taking some cool photos, it was family time. I hope this not only reaches the fans of horror movie lovers, zombie lovers, and Michael Myers fans but everyone. There is a deeper layer to all of this, which is time spent with your family.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-112560 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/16-78.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1049" /></p>

<p>“Whatever you choose to do with your children, do something with them!” Tiffany said. “Children need our time, they need us, they need laughs, giggles, hugs, and adventure. That is what they will remember. They aren’t going to remember eating cake and berries off of some fake intestines.”</p>
