			<h2>Sometimes, love is all cats need.</h2>
<p>Cats can give us the impression that they don&#8217;t care, but the truth is they do. They also want our love and affection. The ones that have been abandoned. They need love and care the most.</p>
<p>We are going to praise people who give pets the love and care they deserve instead of focusing on people who abandon their pets. A girl named Bree Taylor in Australia was walking her dog when she noticed something strange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-182791" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bree.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="700" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bree.jpg 525w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/bree-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While walking on Branch Creek Road in Dalby, Bree and her dog heard something in the grass field. Normally, when you hear a noise from a bush, it is not a problem, but when you live in Australia, the chances are it is a big snake.</p>
<p>It was nothing like that. She was surprised that it was a small group of kittens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-182792" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kittens.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="960" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kittens.jpg 720w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kittens-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The kittens were coming towards her. She didn&#8217;t know what to do as she thought they were cats and that their mother would be nearby. This is how she described the <a href="https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/ten-adorable-stray-kittens-follow-dalby-woman-home/news-story/cf8e3e3af5c1379c6425fd5ab09fe215">scene</a>.</p>
<p>“Honestly I thought they were little ferals coming out to attack my puppy and sort of stood back ‘cause I thought mumma cat was going to come out.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-182793" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/doggo.png" alt="" width="490" height="766" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/doggo.png 490w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/doggo-192x300.png 192w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How Bree found the kittens.</h2>
<p>The kittens were alone. In the middle of nowhere, they were all alone.</p>
<p>“They came right up, so I sat on the ground and they were purring and really hungry.”</p>
<p>The kittens were excited and happy when they saw Bree. They wanted someone to show them, love.</p>
<p>“I just couldn’t believe there were ten and I was just more surprised that all they wanted was a cuddle. They were very hungry. I knew they weren’t feral because they weren’t hissing they were meowing and jumping on me. They definitely knew what a human was.”</p>
<p>The time had come to think of what to do with the little kittens. She decided to take them home because they were too young.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-182794" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kitten-2.jpg" alt="" width="539" height="960" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kitten-2.jpg 539w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kitten-2-168x300.jpg 168w" sizes="(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I was more nervous they were going to get run over by a truck and the fact I couldn’t carry them all.”</p>
<p>That was a challenge. She couldn&#8217;t carry them all because her home was far away and she thought she would get something to carry them in.</p>
<p>She left after she decided this as she didn&#8217;t know that all of this wasn&#8217;t needed. Then she turned around and saw that all the kittens were following her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-182795" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kittens-following-bree.png" alt="" width="494" height="806" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kittens-following-bree.png 494w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/kittens-following-bree-184x300.png 184w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They followed her for over a mile and a half until one of them got tired, so she picked him up and carried him herself. The rest followed her and her dog until they got home.</p>
<p>Wait, it didn&#8217;t end here. When she told the whole story on Facebook, people banded together to help her feed the stray kittens and get them vaccines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of people reached out to her after her post went public. The importance of taking care of stray cats was <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5797699/Queensland-ten-kittens-follow-Dalby-woman-home-walking-dog.html">stressed</a> by Bree.</p>
<p>“If you can’t afford to desex your cat, or look after and find homes for kittens don’t own a cat. Don’t dump them on the road after they are already reliant on humans — it’s cruelty.”</p>
<p>After finding loving homes for all of her little furballs, she rehomed nine of the ten kittens and adopted one herself.</p>
