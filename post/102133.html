			<h2>We need animals in our life.</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is one thing that we all can agree to, it is that the world has become a cruel place to live in. It&#8217;s because no one really cares about anyone else and only worried about their own selves. In short, we have lost humanity. This means that if we are doing anything, it is just for our personal gain and it is not good. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But in between all the bad things, there is something good too. Even if we can’t trust anyone anymore, we can totally rely on our furry friends. Be it a cat, dog, or any other animal, they are all pure. It is actually good that they are not like us otherwise we would never know what unconditional love and care feel like in this cruel world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter whether you are having a bad day or you simply want to see the goddess left in this world, scroll down and fall in love with these cuties.</span></p>
<h2>1. He found his favorite place in the world.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102134 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1-11.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="493" /></p>
<p>There is so much comfort in the arms of someone you love.</p>
<h2>2. Love and happiness are palpable.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102135 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/2-11.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="600" /></p>
<p>I want to be this happy in life.</p>
<h2>3. “My daughter wanted to hug this horse, so as if on cue he just gently put his head down near her.”</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102136 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3-11.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="555" /></p>
<p>I guess he wanted to hug her too.</p>
<h2>4. I bet you’re wishing this was you.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102137 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/4-11.jpg" alt="" width="608" height="600" /></p>
<p>It looks like something straight out of a Disney movie.</p>
<h2>5. “Our cat waits outside every morning to be with my son while he waits for the bus.”</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102138 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/5-11.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="600" /></p>
<p>Always by your side.</p>
<h2>6. After being lost for 5 hours, he’s back in his mom’s arms where he belongs.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102139 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/6-11.jpg" alt="" width="645" height="600" /></p>
<p>Finally home.</p>
<h2>7. This is heartwarming.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102140 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/7-11.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="492" /></p>
<p>I have a feeling they’re going to be the best of friends.</p>
<h2>8. “My 25th birthday present was wolf kisses.”</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102141 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8-10.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="474" /></p>
<p>If you’re scared of wolves, this image might help.</p>
<h2>9. Hugs really are the best thing in the world and even pandas know it.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102142 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9-10.jpg" alt="" width="724" height="600" /></p>
<p>A panda’s hugs must be so warm.</p>
<h2>10. “My sister left for a week, this is how her cockatoo greeted her when she got back!”</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102143 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/10-9.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="555" /></p>
<p>I think it is pretty clear how much he missed her.</p>
<h2>11. Your turn now!</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102144 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/11-9.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>I’ve never seen anyone so excited to give a hug.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know you would agree that all these pictures are absolutely cute and the emotions of these animals are totally pure. And also that we surely don’t deserve all their love and attention because we are not as pure as them.</span></p>
<h2>12. “When you tell her a story that she doesn’t understand, but she loves you anyway”</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102145 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12-9.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="777" /></p>
<p>That is such a kind and reassuring smile.</p>
<h2>13. You just know he loves her with all his heart.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102146 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/13-8.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="970" /></p>
<p>I want some doggo hugs too!</p>
<h2>14. Bella was recently adopted and the expression on her face tells you it’ll be a lifetime of love.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102147 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/14-8.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="970" /></p>
<p>Adoption can change lives.</p>
<h2>15. “As I was saying goodbye, my dog did this…”</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102148 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/15-9.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="970" /></p>
<p>I’m not crying, you’re crying.</p>
<h2>16. “She was yelling, ‘auntie he’s squishing me!’ and I looked back to find him completely content.”</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102149 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/16-9.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="874" /></p>
<p>I would happily get squished by him.</p>
<h2>17. When the clothes of the person you’re hugging have just been washed:</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102150 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/17-9.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="921" /></p>
<p>The scent!</p>
<h2>18. “You’ll be ok, hooman. I gotchu.”</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102151 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/18-8.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="894" /></p>
<p>The best kind of comfort.</p>
<h2>19. This much tenderness can make anyone smile.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102152 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/19-6.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="503" /></p>
<p>Let me love you, human!</p>
<h2>20. A thankful giraffe smooching her caretaker.</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102153 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20-7.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>Kissing his whole face!</p>
<h2>21. “Rescued a feral kitten. Turns out he is also a snuggler.”</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102154 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/21-6.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="555" /></p>
<p>So warm. So snuggly.</p>
<h2>22. Let me snuggle you, bestie!</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-102155 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/22-4.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="1294" /></p>
<p>Hugs incoming!</p>
