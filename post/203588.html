			<p>Most of us probably had bouts of teenage angst when we were teens. Even the best teens get into fights with their parents. It is a fact of life. How each set of parents handles their teenage son or daughter is the only question. Some parents ground their kids or take away some objects. I am sure some of us have been punished for our attitudes.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think any teen has ever had this punishment before.</p>
<p>A classic parental move for a teen who likes to slam doors is to remove the door. I will tell you that when privacy is lost, you gain a lot of perspectives. The dad decided to take the punishment to a new level.</p>
<p>The dad took some action to teach his son a lesson because he was fed up with him slamming his bedroom door in his face. The picture was taken by the teen&#8217;s younger brother, who posted it on the internet last week. Do you see the issue with the picture, besides the depressed look on the young man&#8217;s face?</p>
<p>His door is gone, but not completely.</p>

<p>The dad went out to the shed, got his tools, and planned a creative way to punish his son. What did he do? He sawed his son&#8217;s door in half and turned it into a Dutch door. (We are wondering if the family is Dutch, or if it is just a coincidence because the younger brother who posted the picture goes by the user name the Dutch Bandit.)</p>
<p>This son won&#8217;t slam his door in his father&#8217;s face for a long time. He needs to save up his money for a new door and hinges at the hardware store.</p>

<p>The picture on Reddit – which was captioned “When your brother gets his door cut in half as punishment for slamming the door” has gotten over 2,200 views in the past week and hundreds upon hundreds of hilarious comments. Most people relate to the teen&#8217;s pain by telling of times when their parents punished them.</p>
<p>A woman wrote: <em><strong>“My father made me walk out of the house, close the screen door, and walk down the porch steps 100 times. I didn’t run out of the house slamming the door anymore.”</strong></em></p>
<p>Another one wrote: <em><strong>“My parents removed my entire door. Then gave it back to me for Christmas. Bow and all. Lesson learned.”</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yikes. Have you ever been punished by your parents for your bad behavior? Have you ever taught your kids a lesson in a clever way? The comments section is where you can share your thoughts.</p>
