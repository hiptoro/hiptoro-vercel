			<p>A plus-size empowerment coach is upset with airlines for their small seats and toilets.</p>
<p>Meg Goldberger, a plus-size passenger, demanded that airlines give her business or first-class upgrades when seats are available.</p>
<p>She said that she has experienced fat-phobia on flights from fellow passengers and airline staff.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want airlines to offer us business or first class upgrades for free if there are empty seats,&#8221; Goldberger said in an interview with The Sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won’t pay for it but it means we get access to bigger toilets and bigger seats,&#8221; she continued, adding the upgrade was necessary because: &#8220;It makes flying more comfortable for me.&#8221;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-206674" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/280028729_339048924985732_6987320303288309161_n.jpg" alt="" width="1440" height="1800" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I weigh the same as Olympic bodybuilders or weight lifters. They get free upgrades so should I. It’s only fair we get bigger seats and safe spaces,&#8221; she argued.</p>
<p>Goldberger talked about how she has to endure physical and emotional pain on planes, and how her fellow passengers mock her.</p>
<p>She claims people called her a fat cow and told her she was in the cargo hold while she was walking down the cabin aisle.</p>

<p>&#8220;We suffer long-term trauma or PTSD from in-flight fat shaming,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Goldberger claimed she faced discrimination from other passengers.</p>

<p>On a recent flight, she had to contend with fat-phobia from airline staff, who she had to repeatedly ask for a seatbelt extender. She said she had to work out how to use it herself after they brought her one.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was terrified to ask for one and couldn&#8217;t find any information about seat size, tray table reach or plus size assistance and support on the airline&#8217;s website,&#8221; the embodiment coach explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plus size people should not have to endure bullying and fat shaming on planes,&#8221; she added.</p>
