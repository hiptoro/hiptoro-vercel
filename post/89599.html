			<p>A farewell is an expression of good wishes at a parting. But, when a child says it to their parents what could it really mean?</p>
<p>Parenting is not at all an easy task. Parenting ensures the good health of a child, safety, and preparing children for life as productive adults and transmitting cultural values. As a parent, everyone wants the best for their children. Soon as they grow up and reach their teenagers, we see quite a lot of unwanted activities.</p>
<p>They inevitably start returning late at home, mix up with all unknown friends. This is when you start worrying as a parent. The most important for a parent is that their child should be healthy and happy. One should be aware of what a child is doing in their absence or when they are away.</p>

<p>Let me share with you a story of a father who was searching for her daughter and found a letter instead of her bed.</p>
<p>Steven was searching for her daughter Anna. He was depressed as his favorite team has lost the match last night. His daughter should have been in the room but she was not there.</p>
<p>He walked up to her room, only to find the door open. On her bed, he saw a hand-written note.</p>
<p>This is what it said-</p>
<p>Dear Mom and Dad,</p>
<p>I’m sorry to have to tell you like this, but I’m eloping with my new boyfriend Muhammad.</p>
<p>I’ve finally found true love, and he’s just great! I especially love his cute piercings, sexy scars, cool tattoos and his big motorcycle!</p>
<p>And that’s not all – I’m expecting a child with Muhammad, and I’m already three months pregnant. We’re going to settle down in his trailer, and he says that he wants even more children. I’m so happy!!! And guess what? We’re going to get married next week!</p>
<p>He’s also explained to me that weed isn’t as bad as some people make it out to be, so now we’re growing 17 plants behind our trailer. We’ll have enough for him and his friends, and in return, they’ll give us as many pills as we want.</p>
<p>I do hope that they find a cure for herpes soon, so that Muhammad can get better – he really deserves it. Don’t worry about money – Muhammad’s friends Juan and Stanislav are in the movie business, and they’ve arranged for me to become an actress!</p>
<p>The job pays pretty well, 50 dollars per take, and I get another 50 if there are more than three men in the same scene. So don’t worry about me – I’m 16 years old and can take care of myself.</p>
<p>The next time I come to visit, you’ll get to see your grandchild!</p>
<p>xoxo Anna</p>
<p>P.S. Dad, none of this is true – I only popped over to Emma’s place to watch some TV. I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than The Patriots losing to The Eagles!</p>
<p>See you in a bit!</p>
