			<p>We have a new winner this week! <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/meghan-markle-tearfully-breaks-down-in-new-explosive-netflix-documentary/">Netflix</a> docuseries <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/we-get-it-you-hate-your-family-piers-morgan-attacks-prince-harry-meghan-markle-on-day-of-queens-funeral/"><em>Harry &amp; Meghan</em></a> has officially dethroned Tim Burton-helmed Addams Family spin-off  <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/christina-ricci-played-wednesday-addams-before-jenna-ortega-and-people-are-just-only-realizing-it/"><em>Wednesday</em></a> to become the most-watched movies and individual TV programs from the past week across linear television and streaming. Directed by Liz Garbus, the host interacts with Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle, who talk about their relationship and engagement.</p>
<p>The latest edition of Samba TV’s Weekly Wrap report collects data from an extensive panel of more than 3 million households drawn from over 25 million connected TVs balanced to the U.S. Census. The streaming giant has bagged the top 10 rankings this week. <em>Harry &amp; Meghan</em> claimed the top three spots on the list. However, <em>Wednesday </em>is still active in the competition. The series claimed the rest of the seven spots. <em>Harry &amp; Meghan </em>bombarded the competition as Tim Burton&#8217;s series was ruling the platform with impressive figures.</p>
<h2>Harry &amp; Meghan rules Netflix</h2>
<p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle had stupendous publicity before the show&#8217;s airing. Surprisingly, the show logged 97.71 million hours in its second week. Moreover, it is bigger than the opening weekend figures of 81.55 million. Every kind of publicity is publicity. Almost every critic slammed the docuseries with negative reviews. But the tempting content and a look into the life of the royals were enough to drive the audience to its front step.</p>

<p>The docuseries has been surrounded by constant controversy. It was recently reported that a close member of the Royal Family is upset with Harry and Meghan. One source quipped, &#8220;Kate feels hurt and betrayed that Harry would do this to her, too, especially as the pair used to be so close.&#8221; The source further claimed that the Prince of Wales is not going to react publicly and &#8220;isn’t planning to give his side of the story or openly retaliate.&#8221; The source further said, &#8220;He’s remaining dignified and is getting on with the job,&#8221; the report added, quoting the source.&#8221;</p>
