			<p>The Simpsons first premieres on Fox back in 1989. It&#8217;s the longest-running animated series in American history. The show is known for more than its relatable characters and hilarious situations.</p>
<p>From predicting the plot twists of <em>Game of Thrones</em> to Kamala Harris’ all-purple inauguration outfit, check out some of the most impressive future predictions spotted on <em>The Simpsons</em> in the gallery below!</p>
<h2>#1 Kamala Harris Dress In Purple</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-198624 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/1-13.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1288" /></p>
<h2>#2 Three-Eyed Fish</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-198625 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/2-13.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="348" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The three-eyed fish swimming around the polluted waters around Springfield has become somewhat of a running joke in <em>The Simpsons</em>. However, the joke became reality when someone actually caught a three-eyed fish near a nuclear power plant in Argentina.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#3 Donald Trump’s Presidency</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-198626 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/3-13.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="523" /></p>
<p><em>&#8220;The Simpsons </em>predicted the election of Donald Trump back in the year 2000, 16 years before he was actually elected.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#4 The Prediction Of Higgs Boson Or “God Particle”</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-198627 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/4-13.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="437" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Scientists confirmed the existence of the Higgs Boson, aka the “God particle” back in 2012. However, someone noticed that in one episode of <em>The Simpsons</em>, Homer wrote an equation that predicted the mass of the particle 14 years before its discovery.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#5 Faulty Voting Machine</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-198628 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/5-12.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="793" /></p>
<p>&#8220;In a 2008 episode of <em>The Simpsons</em>, a faulty voting machine caused Homer to choose Mitt Romney instead of Obama during the election. This prediction became reality 4 years later when faulty voting machines in Pennsylvania caused an identical situation.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#6 Tom Hanks</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-198629 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/6-12.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1417" /></p>
<h2>#7 Got Season 8 Plot Twist</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-198630 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/7-12.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="690" /></p>
<p>&#8220;To everyone’s surprise, <em>The Simpsons </em>predicted the <em>Game of Thrones</em> Season 8 plot twist incredibly accurately.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#8 Smartwatches</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-198631 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/8-11.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="535" /></p>
<p><em>&#8220;The Simpsons</em> predicted smartwatches all the way back in 1995.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#9 White Tiger Attack</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-198632 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/9-12.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="259" /></p>
<p>&#8220;A 1993 episode of <em>The Simpsons </em>showed Siegfried &amp; Roy being attacked by their white tiger – something that happened in real life 10 years later.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#10 Nobel Prize Winner</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-198633 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/10-12.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="931" /></p>
<p><em>&#8220;The Simpsons </em>predicted that Bengt Holmström will win the Nobel Prize 6 years before he actually did.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#11 Disney Buying 20th Century Fox</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-198634 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/11-11.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="463" /></p>
<p>&#8220;In one 1998 episode of the show, Homer created a script that was produced by 20th Century Fox. A sign above the studio’s entrance had a small line of text saying “a division of Walt Disney Co.” This joke turned into reality 19 years later when Disney purchased 20th Century Fox for $52.4 billion.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#12 Lady Gaga’s Performance At The Super Bowl</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-198635 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/12-11.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="397" /></p>
<p><em>&#8220;The Simpsons</em> predicted Lady Gaga’s incredible Super Bowl performance 5 years before it actually happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even though autocorrect was launched in 2005, <em>The Simpsons </em>predicted it in 1994, when Lisa was shown using a device called Apple Newton to write ”Beat up Martin”, and got the text corrected into “Eat up Martha”.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#14 First Generation iPod</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-198637 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/14-10.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="1058" /></p>
<p>&#8220;A device eerily similar to the first generation iPod made an appearance on a 1996 episode of the show, 5 years before the device was officially launched.&#8221;</p>
<h2>#15 Horse Meat Scandal</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-198638 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/15-11.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="546" /></p>
<p>&#8220;A 1994 episode of the show showed lunch lady Doris using “assorted horse parts” to prepare meals for the students of Springfield Elementary. 9 years later, Ireland’s Food Safety Authority discovered that over one-third of the beef burger samples from supermarkets had horse meat in them.&#8221;</p>
