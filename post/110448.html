			<p>Dogs are considered to be man&#8217;s best friend, but it is not too far that cats have become a part of human life in the most comfortable manner. People have been obsessed with cats even before the age of YouTube. Back in 1894, inventor Thomas Edison shared a video of two kittens boxing with each other. This indicates the interest of humans in the cat family.</p>
<p>However, the only difference that studies state is that dogs and cats have a different way of being domesticated. The A recent survey of cat genes suggests that the felines might have actually domesticated us, and not the other way around. In ancient times, cats in Europe and Asia used to go towards the farmlands and built a bond with humans.</p>
<p>“I think that there was no need to subject cats to such a selection process since it was not necessary to change them,” Eva-Maria Geigl, an evolutionary geneticist, told National Geographic a few years ago. “They were perfect as they were.”</p>
<p>A Facebook page named OMG Meow shared a list of different cat breed that has been existing in the world for the longest time. Check out the list and leave your comments below about what you think about these kittens.</p>
