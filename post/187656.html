			<p>Whenever we hear animal adoption stories, it makes us smile. Like this story of a Reddit user, <strong>flyingglotus</strong> who adopted a rescued kitten 3 months ago. Flyingglotus and his wife came forward to offer a permanent home to a kitten who had multiple health problems.</p>
<p>They brought Posey, their little kitten, to their vet â€“ returning multiple times for routine checkups.</p>
<p>Posey was put on antibiotics to help stave off further infection and reduce her symptoms, but she was plagued throughout the ordeal by conjunctivitis and respiratory infection.</p>
<p>Flyingglotus and his wife mentioned the following in their imgur post:</p>
<p><em>We had to keep her in our basement bathroom for almost a month.<br />
At this point she had severe conjunctivitis, ringworm all over her body, and still had a URI.<br />
We were really concerned about her.<br />
She was on oral antibiotics, eye drops, and sulfur baths.</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, Posey hung in there and now, after a month of treatment, she can breathe and thrive in her new home!</p>
