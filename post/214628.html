			<p>Pierce Brosnan played the cool, collected, and very suave secret agent, who most of us know better as James Bond.</p>
<p>His career has been going on for more than 30 years, and he has been in movies like Dante&#8217;s Peak, The Thomas Crown Affair, and, most recently, &#8220;Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again&#8221;.</p>
<p>Behind the handsome Irish man is a sad story that has put a lot of stress on his family and led him to do good things for others.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, the 66-year-old man has lost a lot of people he loved very much. First, he lost his wife, and then, 22 years later, his daughter died from the same illness that had killed her mother. He is very sad because he has lost both of these people.</p>

<p>When the American actor first saw his future wife, Cassandra Harris, he was shocked by how beautiful she was and said that he &#8220;never for a second thought&#8221; that she would be the person he would spend the next 17 years of his life with.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>On the other hand, Cassandra had many different ideas about this rising star: “Here was this funny-looking man with this short haircut. But we had much in common… and once we started talking, we never stopped,” she said of her first meeting with Brosnan, according to <a href="https://daily.lessonslearnedinlife.com/pierce-brosnan-first-wife-cassandra-harris-loss-death-cancer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Lessons Learned in Life.</a></p>
<p>Before getting married in 1980, the couple went out on dates for a total of three years. They had a child together and eventually couldn&#8217;t live without each other. After Chris and Charlotte&#8217;s biological father died in 1986, Brosnan took custody of them, Cassandra&#8217;s children from a previous marriage, and adopted them.</p>

<p>Even though he didn&#8217;t have a father and his mother eventually sent him to live with relatives in Ireland while she worked in London, Brosnan took to family life like a fish to water. And yet, many years later, he was a loving husband, father, and stepfather, and he was happy with his life.</p>
<p>“We just clicked as a family. To begin with, I was Pierce, then I was Daddy Pierce, and then I just became Dad. Charlotte and Chris have just been amazing in my life,” Brosnan told the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/pierce-brosnan-pays-tribute-darling-2017552" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Mirror</a> newspaper.</p>
<p>But this happy marriage would end when Cassandra found out in the late 1980s that she had ovarian cancer. They had been married for 11 years when she died in 1991.</p>

<p>In Mexico, Brosnan and his second wife, the American journalist Keely Shaye Smith, finally found the happiness they had been searching for. In 2001, the couple got married, and since then, they have been blessed with two sons.</p>
<p>When his adopted daughter Charlotte died of ovarian cancer 22 years after, it was yet another tragedy in his life.</p>
<p>“I don’t look at the cup as half full, believe me. The dark, melancholy Irish black dog sits beside me from time to time,” he told <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a53654/pierce-brosnan-the-son/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Esquire</a> magazine.</p>
<p>The famous person went back to his first love, painting, as a way to get through a hard time. He now raises money for cancer research and is an ambassador for UNICEF Ireland. He also gives some of the money from the sales of his paintings to groups that help women, children, and the environment.</p>

<p>At the time of her death, Charlotte was 41 years old. She is survived by her husband, Alex, and her two children, Isabella and Lucas.</p>
<p>Reports say that Brosnan said the following while at a Stand Up to Cancer event: “To watch someone you love have his or her life eaten away bit by bit by this insidious disease, that kind of sorrow becomes an indelible part of your psyche.</p>
<p>“I held the generous, strong, beautiful hand of my first wife Cassie as ovarian cancer took her life much too soon. And just last year, I held the hand of my funny, wonderful daughter Charlotte before she too died from this wretched, inherited disease.”</p>

<p>Cancer is a terrible disease that touches each and every one of us in some way. No matter how hard it is, we must never stop looking for a cure.</p>
