			<h2>Another day, another beautiful story of how stray kittens became part of a family!</h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">This story is all about feelings of how shelterless animals become part of our family. </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Two tiny cats were rescued from the trash by a woman named </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Cathy McCaughan.  </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">She was passing by trash, where she heard a squeaking noise inside it. After she went towards the trash she found two adorable little kittens meowing. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Cathy took out those little ones from the trash to rescue them and she tried everything possible she could to save their lives. It was really hard for her to save them because they were so tiny and malnourished. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Cathy rescued and brought them home along with her and offered them good care. She treated the kittens as her own children. She use to feed them through a syringe as they were so tiny and weak. Cathy gave proper medicines for quick recovery and also spent sleepless nights taking care of them. Cathy kept them in a warm and cozy place so they could get better soon. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">She started calling them by their cute names Buttercup and Westley given by her. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Adopting those babies was the best decision. Before these two furries, Cathy already owned other pets Gimli – her cat, and Molley – her dog. Her pets also got new friends. Since Cathy offered better care, Buttercup and Westley started getting healthy, seeing this Cathy became less anxious. Cathy was happy to see that kittens were getting better. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">She was emotionally attached to them. It’s obvious that one can get attached to those cuties. Well, after a few weeks they started walking and eating on their own. </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Cathy shared: “I love these furballs. I love them for fighting so hard when all of the odds were against them. I love the way they crawl to my face for kisses,”</span></i></p>
<p>Scroll down to have a glimpse of Buttercup and Westley.</p>

<p>Animals can&#8217;t talk our language even they don&#8217;t think like humans. They only need love and love doesn&#8217;t need any medium to talk.</p>
