			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did you know that only 2% of the population has natural red hair? We know it&#8217;s a little surprising but it is true. Now, some people see it as a great and unique feature. And honestly, it’s good because this is what makes the world a better place to live in. But there are people who are ready to pull others down because they find them &#8220;odd&#8221;. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">But whatever, we should only see this thing as individuality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You will be happy to know that there is a popular 39-year-old Scottish photographer who has been capturing pictures of people for 7 years. His name is Kieran Dodds and he captures the picture of people who have a common trait, i.e., ginger hair. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Look, stare and marvel, that’s the whole point. Find connections across the world. I want people to compare the portraits and delight in our variety even without an apparently homogenous group. We are made of the same stuff but we are uniquely tuned,&#8221; he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scroll down to have a look at the amazing pictures. </span></p>

<p>&#8220;In 2014, Scotland voted on independence and I was considering the cliches of identity. I knew I was one of them, being pale and ginger, but very early on in the research process, I found that it is a global trait. Even Scotland, as the global capital, has 13% of people at most showing the hair color. There were two hot spots, it claimed, one in Scotland and Ireland that is confirmed by science—the Celtic Fringe. The other hot spot was in Russia that was confirmed by an anecdote.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our genes have traveled far across history even if we personally have not,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Due to constraints on money (this was all self-funded), I focused my attention on the two hot spots, but also Jamaica. I made work over seven years in different places in the UK. In London, I met gingers from across the world, but in Scotland, I saw that you don’t need to travel far. One lad had an Indian great-grandfather and another had an Eastern European mother and Middle Eastern dad. He is Scottish, but his story expands our expectations of that narrow political term.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I traveled to the city of Perm (an apt name!) and met people who embodied the geographic location with European names and ancestry, but also Asia.</p>
<p>Sveta Ni, in particular, stood out as she said her father’s family line was originally from China. The oldest ginger gene mutation is traced to Central Asia. With gingers in Western China, Afghanistan, and North Pakistan. I would love to go there and continue the project. But the transect I have made across 11 time zones in an attempt to capture this range. To the West, the outlier is Treasure Beach. On the southern coast of Jamaica. The locals shared a story of shipwrecked Scots swimming ashore and setting up home, but the local historian Dr. Bones said the reality is, alas, less romantic than that. He described successive waves of invaders (Spanish conquistadors, French, English, and Scottish groups) who have left their legacy. Black River, a larger settlement nearby, had a slave market to supply labor for the sugar estates. They were joined in the 18th century by Scottish political rebels who were sent to Jamaica as indentured laborers. Over the centuries, the ebbs and flows of human life can be seen in the beautiful people here. The fishing villages here are a quiet and safe bolthole for discerning tourists. It wasn’t a hardship for me to visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ginger is what others call red hair, a spectrum incorporating orange and yellow and brown, an iridescent gold. The Russians call it &#8216;rege&#8217; or rusty, which is better. It’s not red, is it? Blood is red, fire engines are red, stop signs are red.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The series is made to help us see the individual people in this series, that we are made of the same stuff and in the case of hair, it shows. Dividing people into smaller groups based on characteristics seems counterproductive if we continue to see them as an oddity rather than as a unique part of a global human family.&#8221;</p>
