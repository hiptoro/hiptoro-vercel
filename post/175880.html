<p>&#8220;In 2001, my sister got me a Sony phone, a tiny little thing with a flip-down front. She worked in a phone shop and got a discount. The box said the phone was waterproof, and there were tiny rubber seals in places. I believed them.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the pub where I worked, this aspect came up in conversation. Some guy said the phone couldn&#8217;t be waterproof and that shower proof was probably more accurate. Remembering the box, I argued the point . . . And dropped my phone into a pint of beer to prove it. I was wrong. Brutal but a well-earned life lesson.&#8221; ⏤Queen-of-Beans</p>
<p>No matter how much something electrical protests to be &#8220;waterproof&#8221; on the box, I never have the faith required to get it wet due to stories like this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put a cigarette out on my arm, Logan-Style (X-Men), because some dudes in my class didn&#8217;t believe me when I told them I don&#8217;t feel much pain in the arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to work at a movie theatre. As it gets to midnight, all the employees hang out behind the concessions counter, chat, and eat the popcorn before we have to throw it out, etc. One of them dared someone to do a butter shot. But like, the liquid butter for popcorn is way closer to straight oil. Such an oil shot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m always a fiend for attention, so I said pass it to me, and I downed it without letting myself think about the consequences. It tasted like liquid plastic, and I hated it, but everyone was howling and incredulous, and I felt relaxed for a whole minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;In grade school, maybe age 11 or 12, I had these cheap jeans. I figured out that I could flex my belly and pop the button open, I found this funny, and my guy friends in the class laughed too. One of them turns to a girl, &#8216;hey, check out what [brother_meowzone] can do.&#8217; I flexed my belly and let out a huge fart while the button popped open. She turned away, my buddy laughed, and I never did this trick again.&#8221; ⏤brother_meowzone</p>

<p>&#8220;Stuck my tongue to a metal pole on the playground in the dead of winter. To my credit, I had not yet seen &#8216;A Christmas Story,&#8217; and my friend&#8217;s older brother had just said &#8216;don&#8217;t put your tongue on that&#8217; and not in a warning tone. More of a &#8216;you won&#8217;t&#8217; tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We all now know what the result is when you put a tongue to a metal pole in the dead of winter. My tongue instantly stuck to the pole. I was stunned. To make matters worse, the morning recess bell rang. In a panic, I grabbed my tongue and ripped it off. Blood was everywhere. Fast forward a quick trip to the hospital, and I got to eat pudding for a week straight.&#8221; ⏤browsing_around</p>
<p>The only way out of these situations is to calm down as much as possible and leave your tongue there until your body heat helps melt it back off. Not that I&#8217;m talking from experience&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not me, but one of my former co-workers told us about the time he ate a tub of butter on a dare. He made it about halfway through and had to throw up. He said what came out was neon yellow. For the next month, the smell of butter made him gag, and when he sweated, he could still smell it.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d think he&#8217;d learn, but he attempted the butter tub challenge a second time. This time, he paced himself and finished the whole thing! He said the problem, though, was eating it before having to catch a train. While he was waiting, his heart was racing, and he felt so excited, he did pushups and jumping jacks at Penn Station.&#8221; ⏤YounomsayinMawfk</p>
