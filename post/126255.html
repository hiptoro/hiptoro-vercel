<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This post is about a dog who has the biggest heart in the world. After she lost all of her puppies, she accepted three orphaned kittens and loved them like her own babies. Her name is Georgia and she taught the world that no matter what species or breed you are, you are capable of loving others. </span></p>

<p>One of the members of the shelter house, named Anita Osa, told us “I’ve never had a mother lose a whole litter before. The best way I could describe it was that she was frantic. She was so sad, she was looking for those babies. She broke the toddler mattress we had her on, trying to find her babies.”</p>

<p>“I introduced them gently. First I took one and let her smell it, and she seemed to accept it, so I brought the others. It’s amazing to see how she calmed down instantly. I think the kittens have no idea that Georgia is a dog.”</p>

<p>“For Georgia, these tiny kittens are her children as she breastfeeds them, she cleans them and everything, but the bond is strong. It’s really something to see, she protects these kittens as if they were her babies,” says Anita excitedly.</p>
