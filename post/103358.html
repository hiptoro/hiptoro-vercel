<h2>Modern adventurer Blair Braverman told the internet all about her sled dog Grinch</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-103359 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-3.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="266" /></p>

<p>Braverman lives up to her last name: she does, indeed, take risks in her everyday life. What’s more, she also uses storytelling to make the outdoors accessible to her readers.</p>

<h2>We think Grinch is an adorable doggo and a truly good boy</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-103364 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/6-2.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="929" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Braverman has written has appeared in The Guardian, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smithsonian, This American Life, and elsewhere as she is such a phenomenal author. This thing makes her a role model for jocks and geeks alike.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we checked her website, we found that she has been training her dog for the Iditarod, a 1,000-mile dog sled race across Alaska. Although Braverman is 31-years-old, her spirits are not old. She loves her life so much and she’s the perfect proof that adventuring isn’t gone with age. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be glad to know that sled dogs have been around for nearly 9,000 years. This dog breed is taken care of better than most of your regular doggos. It&#8217;s because they are running dogs that are very important for transportation. So they need to have good health. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you also love sled dogs, you might know the popular story where sledding dogs helped save the Alaskan town of Nome in 1925. It was the time when there was an outbreak of diphtheria. And the only way to beat this illness was a serum that was 1,000 miles away in Anchorage. Even the closest ship that could bring the serum was  ‘mere’ 674 miles away. So everything has become quite complicated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But then Sledding dogs came to rescue. That time, the town of Nome used a relay of dog sledding teams to bring the serum and save the lives of people. The dogs were divided into teams and the last one was led by Gunnar Kaasen. His team had a cool name Balto. While they were on their way, they were caught in the bizarre temperature. But the brave Balto didn’t surrender. Rather, they kept moving forward with more force because of which the outbreak of diphtheria was narrowly averted in Nome.</span></p>
<h2>Dog sledding enthusiasts and amateurs alike enjoyed Braverman’s story about Grinch</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have also interviewed TheMissingByte to know more about the story of Grinch and Braverman.</span></p>
<p>TheMissyingByte while explaining how Grinch&#8217;s story getting a boost online and spreading like wildfire. “I originally sent this Facebook post to a friend of mine who couldn’t view it correctly as he doesn’t have an account. So I pulled the images together into a gallery so he could see the story. I shared it with the community because I figured people would like.&#8221;</p>
<p>“The post making it to the front page didn’t surprise me too much, it’s a funny story about a dog. The internet loves that kind of stuff!” TheMissingByte said. “I think what Braverman does is admirable and impressive. She’d make a great role model for young women everywhere if sledding were more widely talked about.”</p>
<p>TheMissingByte also expressed their opinion about Braverman&#8217;s spirit. “If you’ve not done it before, there is still adventure to be had. There is a lot to be said about the difference in watching someone through a screen and being there doing the same thing in person. Get out there and get busy, the world is dying so you should be enjoying what it has to offer while you still can.”</p>
