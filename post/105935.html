			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello people! There is a story that I want to share with you all. It&#8217;s about my pet Molly who is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">going to be a big sister to a little human. Since Molly is going to become a sister, she surely needs a room of her own. That’s why I have decided to construct it for her. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the baby arrived, I had started making a room under stairs where nothing existed before. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since it was walled-in, I wasn&#8217;t sure about how much space is available or how great the room will look. But luckily, everything went as planned and I and Molly both are happy with the results. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can scroll down to see how we have constructed the room.</span></p>
<h2>Molly in her new, finished room</h2>

<h2>She is the best wee dog who had been very spoiled up to this point, so we didn’t want her to feel less important when the baby arrived!</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-105937 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/2-50.jpg" alt="" width="880" height="1564" /></p>
<h2>And here is the proud big sister with baby Catelyn!</h2>

<h2>Starting point… I thought there might be dead space behind the stairs, but wasn’t sure. Trying to sneak a look</h2>

<h2>If it was going to work I also needed to move the wiring for the house alarm system. Decided to update the kitchen at the same time, by adding tongue &amp; groove panels</h2>

<h2>Most importantly… don’t want Molly to be scared of the space, so in for an early look. Definitely going to be big enough!</h2>
