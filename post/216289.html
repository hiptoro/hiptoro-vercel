			<p>Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith have been together for a very long time. They have already been married for 25 years. But their relationship isn&#8217;t normal at all. After being together for more than 20 years, the Smiths said that their marriage is open. This means that they can date other people and still be married. Even though this is the case, they still love each other.</p>
<p>We at <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hiptoro</span></strong> have decided to make a timeline of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith&#8217;s relationship.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>They met for the first time in 1990.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216296" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/042c1355309179dfdf58420cda.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="610" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/042c1355309179dfdf58420cda.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/042c1355309179dfdf58420cda-300x251.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>In 1990, when he was 22 and she was 19, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett met. Will was cast as the main character in the sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and the young actress auditioned for the role of his girlfriend. Jada didn&#8217;t get the part because she isn&#8217;t tall enough. Will is much taller than her.</p>
<p>Will said later that they fell in love at first sight. At the time, though, they were just friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>After five years, they started going out together.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216295" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4967715319998c00fed708a3d6.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="522" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4967715319998c00fed708a3d6.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4967715319998c00fed708a3d6-300x215.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Will and Jada started going out together five years after they met for the first time. At this point, the actor had already split up with his first wife, Sheree Zampino, who had given birth to their son, Trey, in 1992. (in the left photo). Will didn&#8217;t think divorce was a good idea, but when he met Jada, he realized that his wife wasn&#8217;t the person he was meant to be with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>In 1997, they tied the knot.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216294" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/281aa454618c668a685b9a4803.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="646" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/281aa454618c668a685b9a4803.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/281aa454618c668a685b9a4803-300x266.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Will and Jada got engaged a year after they started dating, but no one said how they did it. In 1997, they were married for real, but it didn&#8217;t work out well for Jada. Jada was three months pregnant when she got married, and she felt very sick the whole time. Jada didn&#8217;t even want to get married because she didn&#8217;t see the point, but her mom made her because she wanted to go to her wedding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Will and Jada have two kids.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216293" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ccb9a055d2ad350f0f75c5d829.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="522" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ccb9a055d2ad350f0f75c5d829.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ccb9a055d2ad350f0f75c5d829-300x215.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>In 1998, their first child, a son named Jaden, came into the world. In 2000, their daughter Willow was born. Later, both kids were in the movies with their father. Jaden did what his famous parents did and became an actor and singer, while Willow is more interested in modeling and hosting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The two people said that their marriage was open.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216292" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f028915b708e17d05cb12a6748.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="522" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f028915b708e17d05cb12a6748.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f028915b708e17d05cb12a6748-300x215.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Will said that he and his wife started out in a traditional, monogamous relationship, but at some point, they &#8220;felt miserable at the same time&#8221; and decided to change how they talked to each other. They were seen out in public with other people, but that didn&#8217;t mean they were divorced. It was just a new way for them to be with each other, no matter how strange it seemed. After living together for a long time, they both came to the same conclusion: &#8220;Marriage can&#8217;t be a prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Jada went out with another man for a while.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216291" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/b327ef577eb5976e327d35df7a.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="837" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/b327ef577eb5976e327d35df7a.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/b327ef577eb5976e327d35df7a-261x300.jpg 261w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>In 2020, Jada confirmed that she was dating American musician August Alsina, despite rumors to the contrary. Jada said that about 4.5 years ago, she had an affair with the musician. This affair happened around the time she broke up with Smith.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to feel good, it had been so long since I felt good,” she revealed about her relationship with August. But their romance was temporary and soon after, Jada realized, “You can’t find happiness outside yourself.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Even though they have an open marriage, they still love each other.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-216290" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f023575837a04c602bd3263cf9.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="522" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f023575837a04c602bd3263cf9.jpg 728w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/f023575837a04c602bd3263cf9-300x215.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p>Even though they are seeing other people, they are still the most important people in each other&#8217;s lives. They don&#8217;t call what they have together a marriage. Instead, they call it a &#8220;life partnership.&#8221; “There’s nothing that could happen that we won’t be together and love each other,” Will once said. As they <a href="https://www.etonline.com/jada-pinkett-smith-admits-past-relationship-with-august-alsina-says-she-and-will-were-separated" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">both</a> claim, “We ride together, we die together,” and we truly hope that this bond will never break!</p>
