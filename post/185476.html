			<p>What are the most you have ever been charged for a ride?</p>
<p>Not as much as this guy. Andrew Peters caught a ride using the transportation service platform from Dulles International Airport, but the car got stuck in a storm for hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185478" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/uber-refunds-600-bill-after-passenger-is-stranded-on-i-95.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1200" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bill for the nine-hour journey was $600 and it was due to icy roads and lots of traffic.</p>
<p>The man who was returning from San Francisco and the driver were unaware of the weather when they started their ride.</p>
<p>“It was kind of scary,” Peters said. “We didn’t have any food or water.”</p>
<p>Peters said that he was charged an extra $400 after initially being hit with a $200 bill.</p>
<p>“I’m still trying to find somebody to talk to, to understand why they feel like they could charge me this,” said Peters.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/my-upfront-fare-was-not-honored?nodeId=ff65490e-2ffb-41cf-a709-4611521c7b24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Uber’s website</a>, “heavy traffic may cause your trip to take longer than expected, and to compensate your driver for the additional time, your fare may change.”</p>
<p>The additional charge has been disputed by Peters.</p>
<p>It looks like the passenger will be getting his money back.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to The Associated Press, Uber said, “We have refunded Mr. Peters after this terrible ordeal and are so glad that he and his Uber driver got home safely,” and confirmed the driver’s pay would not be affected either.</p>
<p>In Virginia, thousands of people were left without food or water for hours on an interstate. Police said that the road became unsafe when tractor-trailers jackknifed.</p>
