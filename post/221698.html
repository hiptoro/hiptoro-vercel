			<p>Not everybody&#8217;s house will light up this Christmas. <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/bhad-bhabie-made-50m-on-onlyfans-in-2022/">OnlyFans</a> model and social media influencer Rachel Mee was announced dead on Sunday, December 18. Rachel Kaitlyn, from Newcastle, United Kingdom, enjoyed a comfortable following of 40,000 on <a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/funny-instagram-captions/">Instagram</a>. A close friend broke the news writing in a tribute she had &#8220;lost her battle with the pressures of this world.&#8221; However, no cause of death is yet announced. Moreover, her son Kyro was born this year in March.</p>
<p>Mee&#8217;s family reacted to the terrible news. Her brother, Connor, said, &#8220;As many of you know my little sister Rachel Mee passed away suddenly yesterday morning. As a family we are overwhelmed by everyone’s messages and support and there are far too many to reply too. We are absolutely devastated by her loss, she was a sister, aunt, niece &amp; mum to her beautiful boy Kyro and will be missed by everyone who knew her. Rachel was loved so much by a lot of people, but only a few knew the real Rach.&#8221;</p>

<h2>OnlyFans model Rachel Mee dead at 25</h2>
<p>Some of Rachel&#8217;s friends remembered her. Natalie Phillips, former <em>Geordie Shore </em>star said, &#8220;Not convinced this is ever going to sink in. Rest peacefully my darling girl. What I wouldn’t do to take us back to these days. Sleep tight with your Mam and Dad. You have a lot of catching up to do sweetheart. I know how much they will have missed you. Love you loads Rachel. Now and forever. Please hold your loved ones closer tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">MMA fighter Joshua Vogel remembered his friend and neighbor. He has vowed the proceeds of his next fight in February to a fund set up to help Rachel&#8217;s family and Kyro in particular. He said, &#8220;I was Rachel’s and Connor’s neighbour for 13 years, we basically grew up together. I moved away but Rachel was still so pleasant to me and always greeted me and complimented my children and my girlfriend. If Connor doesn’t attend the show I will be handing him the money raised myself. There is also a just giving link people can kindly donate too.</p>

<p class="mol-para-with-font">Vogel continued, &#8220;She was loved by so many people and a lot of people close to me who I also grew up with are supporting her family. You know who you are. I’ll dedicate February the 4th to Rachel Mee and her son Kyro. I am so sorry this happened to you Rachel I really am. I hope you have found your peace and your soul lives on forever. Wherever there is a human being there is an opportunity for kindness.&#8221;</p>
