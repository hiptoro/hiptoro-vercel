			<p>Fusion, the Broad Collie is quite popular on the Internet for knowing more than 150 tricks. He is showing the world what a good pet is like.</p>
<p>One of his tricks was shared by his owner recently, so let&#8217;s discover what is it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-152715 aligncenter" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-64.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="728" /></p>
<p>&#8220;We spend all day, every day together, whether it’s at work or relaxing, or playing Frisbee or doing doggy agility or learning tricks,” Trott told Hiptoro</p>

<p>“Originally, my 10-year-old son insisted on tucking him in. I think Fusion liked it. Now it’s a solid part of our nightly routine,” Steffi said.</p>

<p>Steffi shared the video on her Facebook account, where she wrote: “Fusion’s bedtime ritual. Somehow he came up with this and waits every night to be tucked in. Now he’s 7 years old and still surprises me every day with the incredibly sweet and smart dog that he is.”</p>

<p>“The other two (dogs) get on the bed, but Fusion will stand by his bed. He’ll just stand there and wait and watch me until I come to tuck him in,” Trott said.</p>
<p>The dog is strict about his nightly routine and would always wait for his owner to put him to bed. He refuses to sleep unless the routine is followed.</p>

<p>Fusion&#8217;s mom is always there to tuck him to bed.</p>
