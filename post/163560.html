			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We can never imagine the pain of losing our dogs, but that is something we have to face someday. Just like </span>Steve Creigs did. He lost his dog. And to cope with the pain, he decided to do something amazing.</p>
<p>He chose to adopt all the dogs from a shelter house whom no one wants. It&#8217;s good to say that Steve has formed an adorable army of fluffy boys, and we love them.</p>
<h2>Meet 12-year-old Eeyore, the Chihuahua</h2>

<h2>Without delay, staff at the center presented him with 12-year-old Eeyore, an elderly Chihuahua with four bad knees and a heart murmur.</h2>

<h2>Steve was raised around lots of other animals and loved them. His parents loved pets, and that seems to have rubbed on Steve. After Eeyore, he kept adopting animals in need.</h2>

<h2>Amazingly, Steve would go on to open up his home to a total of 9 unwanted senior dogs and even took in a rabbit, chicken, and pig.</h2>

<p>When asked about his soft spot for senior dogs, steve credits the dogs for being ‘wiser animals.’</p>
<blockquote><p>You kind of know what you want out of life once you become a certain age. These dogs know who they are and it’s easy to develop a relationship with a person or pet who knows who they are.</p></blockquote>
<h2>His daily life is a little bit hectic, as you can imagine!</h2>

<h2>A normal day for him is getting up at 5 am in morning and making breakfast for all of his furbabies, which, you know, there are 10 (dogs), and most of them have different diets.</h2>
<p>He uses the weekends for taking the animals to the vet and other appointments.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I grew up with a lot of pets,” Greig said. “Both my parents were animal lovers and they pretty much always let me have whatever I wanted as long as I could take care of it’.</p></blockquote>

<h2>So, although there is a lot that comes with caring for 13 animals. (some of which have severe health complications) Steve clearly has all the experience he needs to take care of his large family as known as the ‘Wolfgang</h2>
