			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A couple of months ago, people spotted a </span><span style="font-weight: 400">flamboyant-looking ‘patient’ near Wildlife Hospital in the U.K. Since this bird was looking rare and it was not able to fly, people took it to the Tiggywinkles Wildlife Hospital. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the bird was taken to the hospital, it turned out that it was neither tropical nor exotic. It was just a seagull that was covered in curry. </span></p>
<h2>“This is one of the strangest casualty circumstances we have seen in a while!”</h2>

<p>“This bright-orange herring gull was rescued by kind members of the public who spotted him at the side of the A41. When they called to say they had picked up an orange bird, we had no idea what to expect – and would never have guessed at this,” Tiggywinkles Wildlife hospital recently posted on their Facebook page.</p>
<h2>“He had somehow gotten himself covered in curry or turmeric”</h2>

<p>“We have no idea how he got into this predicament but thankfully, apart from the vibrant color and pungent smell, he was healthy,” they added.</p>

<p>“Our veterinary team bravely bathed the gull (now named Vinny after a Vindaloo curry) to clean off his feathers. He managed to cover them in curry water but eventually did let us scrub him clean.”</p>
<h2>“He is now looking much better and should be able to go for release very soon”</h2>

<p>“As we say, we never know what will come through our doors next! Huge thanks to the lovely finders who stopped to rescue him,” Tiggywinkles Wildlife hospital added. All in all, we’re glad that Vinny is okay and hopefully, he won’t get himself into curry anymore.</p>
<h2>Here’s what people had to say about Vinnie’s misfortune</h2>
