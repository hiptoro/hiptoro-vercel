			<p>Kids show us that creativity has no limits. Their curious ideas, big hearts, and vivid imaginations that are stretched as far as the eye can see bring joy and humor to our lives. Children see magic in mundane things and create entertainment out of nothing. We shall see in this post, some of the eeriest things said by them.</p>
<p>Every single mom and dad can agree that kids are cute, honest, and pure, but they are not the only things they are capable of. They have a darker side too. Parents, relatives, and even strangers are taking to the internet to share things that the little ones have told them.</p>
<p>We are going to take a deep dive into the moments when kids casually said something spooky and made everyone around them feel good. There are some strange questions and strange statements about the spirit world that you should be prepared for. Let us know if you have any similar experiences.</p>
<p>Psst! After you finish reading this article, check out our previous ones with kids saying the scariest things and parents realizing their little ones are downright frightening.</p>

<p>My 3-year-old grandson has babbled about plane crashes since he started talking. As the first plane dropped to the ground, he screamed, &#8220;Oh no we crashed!&#8221;. This was the first thing he said. He did this many times.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reading a story to him when he&#8217;s 3. I looked up at him and he said that he was a pilot. &#8220;When they shot off my wing, I crashed into the water.&#8221;</p>
<p>It almost stopped my heart.</p>
<p>He looked sad and troubled. I told him that he had done his best and that I was very proud of him and that he could talk about it whenever he wanted. I hugged him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My daughter used to wake me up by getting 4 inches from my face and staring at me until I opened my eyes. Once my eyes opened, she&#8217;d say, &#8220;Mommy your face is pretty. I want to wear it on my face.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s get some breakfast, Hannibal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children can say things that leave everyone around them gasping, hoping their ears are playing tricks on them. Kids are very curious little creatures, and they will always sneak up on us with their surprising insights. The bizarre questions and statements that stand right on the edge of that muddy line between fantasy and reality are just a few of the ideas they come up with.</p>
<p>People who lean toward the supernatural can become easily spooked since they see their mysterious wisdom as another way of letting their creative genius shine through. It is horror movie material if they hear about a ghost begging for help in the attic or disturbing imaginary friends. It makes life interesting.</p>

<p>I was getting breakfast ready for my 3-year-old when he told me his grandma fell down the stairs. About an hour later, Grandpa called to tell us that grandma had fallen down the stairs.</p>
<p>My 3-year-old said my sister was going to visit the next day and guess who showed up for a surprise visit.</p>

<p>The monsters were under my daughter&#8217;s bed. It was on her mom and me for weeks.</p>
<p>After mom tried to put her to bed, she tagged me in. I was pretty frustrated after 30 minutes. I promised my daughter that there were no monsters under her bed. She replied, &#8220;I know. Now they&#8217;re behind you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I let her sleep with us for a week after that.</p>

<p>We lived in a two-bedroom house when my daughter was young. The two of us were the only ones left. She crept into my bed at night but never said why. One day we were cleaning her room and putting away laundry and she got very agitated and said, “Why is he here now? He said he only comes at night.” I asked if she was talking about Dad. She said, “No the boy with no hands.”</p>
<p>She hasn&#8217;t mentioned him since we moved a few months later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children&#8217;s imaginations can make them challenge their beliefs about ghosts and reincarnation. There are many theories online about how children can communicate with the spirit world. They are usually based on the idea that the little ones don&#8217;t have normal rules in place and spend their days in imaginary fantasy lands. That doesn&#8217;t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>“Children actually are quite good at making the distinction between fantasy and reality at quite a young age, so I don’t [think] they say these things because they’re confused,” <a href="https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/jwoolley" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jacqueline D. Woolley</a>, a psychology professor at the University of Texas who researches children’s evaluation and understanding of reality, told. She thinks children say things to find out what adults will say in order to get information about the world.</p>
<p>“Once they’ve made the fantasy-reality distinction regarding basic things, they need to figure out where unfamiliar or novel things fit in. Saying something that might seem eerie to an adult might be a child’s way of gathering information,” the professor explained.</p>

<p>My child has a night light in his room. He wouldn&#8217;t fall asleep. He was playing and talking to someone. I got him up for a snack because he hadn&#8217;t eaten much for dinner. I fed him some macaroni and cheese from a bowl as he sat on the couch and watched tv.</p>
<p>He was in his room when the light turned on. It&#8217;s odd, but whatever. We went back to watching tv after it turned off again. My son stops and looks down at the empty hall that leads to his bedroom.<br />
His face lit up and he said &#8220;Hiii!&#8221;. He runs up to the darkness and starts talking to it.</p>
<p>He ran back to the darkness, grabbed his fork, and held it up to the light like he was trying to feed it and was getting impatient that it wasn&#8217;t eating. Finally, he waves and says, &#8220;Buh bye!&#8221;. Then goes back to watching tv.</p>
