			<p>Nola Carpenter, who is 81 years old, said she can finally retire after a 15-second video of her went viral about a week ago. But first, she said she would stay at Walmart to help with shopping during the holidays, which are known to be very busy.</p>
<p>On November 3, 19-year-old TikToker Devan Bonagura posted a video of Carpenter sitting at a break room table at a New Jersey Walmart with the caption &#8220;Life shouldn&#8217;t be this hard.&#8221; More than 30 million people have seen it. (Bonagura later told viewers that he didn&#8217;t work for Walmart but for a third-party company that sells products there.) Soon after that, Bonagura set up a GoFundMe page to help pay for Carpenter&#8217;s retirement.</p>
<p>Two days later, Bonagura posted a video of himself meeting up with Carpenter to give her the account, which at the time had $110,000 in donations.</p>

<p>Carpenter thanked the donors and said that the money would help her mortgage go &#8220;way down,&#8221; but she also made it clear that it wouldn&#8217;t be enough for her to retire, as it seemed the donors wanted.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d accept it,&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>she told him of the money,</p>
<blockquote><p>but I&#8217;d still have to work until I get the other $60,000 paid off on the house.</p></blockquote>
<h6></h6>
<p>At Walmart, the average hourly wage is $19, so it would have taken Carpenter a few more years of 40-hour work weeks to save up an extra $60,000. Carpenter couldn&#8217;t retire because she didn&#8217;t have enough money saved up, just like millions of other US workers.</p>
<p>On November 13, Bonagura posted a follow-up video with Carpenter. By that time, GoFundMe had reached $180,000, which was more than what she had said she would need to pay off her mortgage. 13,500 people had given money.</p>

<p>Carpenter told Bonagura that she was &#8220;ecstatic&#8221; about the help and thanked everyone who &#8220;spread the word&#8221; or gave money so she could now retire in comfort.</p>
<blockquote><p>That&#8217;s what I was working at Walmart for — to pay my house off,</p></blockquote>
<p>she explained.</p>
<p>Carpenter told Bonagura that she has worked at Walmart for 20 years and that she&#8217;ll miss the regulars.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m going to miss my customers. They look for me every day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though Carpenter got a windfall, she doesn&#8217;t plan to &#8220;fully retire&#8221; until January.</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m going to help them out for the holidays, and after that, it&#8217;ll be good to stay at home.</p></blockquote>
<p>Insider asked Nola Carpenter and Devan Bonagura for their thoughts, but they didn&#8217;t answer right away.</p>
