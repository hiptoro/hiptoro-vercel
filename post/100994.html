			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we ever get enough of pugs? Um, Nah we can’t. And how can we? After all, they are absolute cuties and just want to shower us with their unconditional love almost all the time. But there is something even cuter than pugs. Do you know what? You don’t? No worries because we know it. It&#8217;s the pug webcomics. Yay! </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are falling in love with this particular breed after seeing the comic and planning to adopt one, there are a few things that you should know. So get ready. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chloe Tejada from Canadian Living says that pugs are really clingy and she got to know about this when she adopted Rosie. Pugs follow their owners literally everywhere. So if you are getting one, just forget about personal space (seriously). </span></p>
<h2>#13<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101012 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-13-46.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></h2>
<h2>#14<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101013 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-14-45.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></h2>
<h2>#15<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-101014 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-15-43.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="700" /></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should also know that pugs aren’t one of the healthiest dog breeds. This is because they can develop breathing problems and different types of allergies. So if you are getting a pug, be ready to take care of their nose folds and eyes. Also, they are high maintenance and they will need cleaning, attention, and of course, food. Not to mention that pugs shed a lot! </span></p>
<p>But they are cute so whatever.</p>
