			<p>There are many clichés in Hollywood.</p>
<p>Older male celebrities dating gorgeous models who are half their age is one of the most common ones.</p>
<p>You might think that actor Pierce Brosnan would fall into that category, but he&#8217;s proved them wrong.</p>
<p>Pierce&#8217;s wife is 10 years younger than him, and she is also a size zero.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>They&#8217;ve been together since 1994.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187549" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qJTedsArwgiax60JZSxU.png" alt="" width="1024" height="770" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qJTedsArwgiax60JZSxU.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qJTedsArwgiax60JZSxU-300x226.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/qJTedsArwgiax60JZSxU-768x578.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>They met at a party where Keely was working.</p>
<p>She was supposed to interview Ted Danson but ended up connecting with him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Brosnan was captivating.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187550" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BXnkTjLER6d2Xta7GIxM.png" alt="" width="1024" height="770" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BXnkTjLER6d2Xta7GIxM.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BXnkTjLER6d2Xta7GIxM-300x226.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BXnkTjLER6d2Xta7GIxM-768x578.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Tall, dark and handsome, everything that everybody would immediately be attracted to,&#8221; Keely told <a href="https://people.com/movies/pierce-brosnan-praises-wife-keely-shaye-smith-57th-birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>People</em></a> in 2001.</p>
<p>The Irish-born actor was in need of something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He was widowed after his wife died of ovarian cancer.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187551" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-440.png" alt="" width="636" height="799" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-440.png 636w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-440-239x300.png 239w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" /></p>
<p>Pierce was a single father after the death of his wife, as he had adopted her children shortly after they were married.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">&#8220;Keely has always been kind and compassionate and encouraged me to mourn Cassie,&#8221; Pierce gushed about his wife during an interview with The Sun.</h2>

I suppose Keely is my North Star, always looking out for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The couple expanded their family in 1997.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-187553" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pierce-Brosnan-Always-Has-His-Wifes-Back-When-Trolls-Attack-Her-Weight.gif" alt="" width="785" height="396" /></p>
<p>Dylan was born in 1997. Paris was born on February 27, 2001, to Pierce and Keely.</p>
<p>Growing up without a father is like Pierce cherishing every single moment of being a father.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>We are all well aware that pregnancy isn&#8217;t an easy thing for women.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187554" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-441.png" alt="" width="636" height="799" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-441.png 636w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-441-239x300.png 239w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" /></p>
<p>After the birth of her two sons, she put on some extra weight.</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re living in a superficial world, people were not too kind about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>People wondered why Pierce would stay with someone who had changed their appearance so much.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-187555" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pierce-Brosnan-Always-Has-His-Wifes-Back-When-Trolls-Attack-Her-Weight_2.gif" alt="" width="693" height="387" /></p>
<p>Critics don&#8217;t realize that the love between Keely and Pierce goes much deeper than the surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He loves his wife the most for her, her family, and the person she is on the inside.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-187556" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/aRHu2BYXHoaJBOiAbjdX.png" alt="" width="648" height="487" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/aRHu2BYXHoaJBOiAbjdX.png 480w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/aRHu2BYXHoaJBOiAbjdX-300x226.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px" /></p>
<p>No number on the scale could change that.</p>
<p>He was her biggest supporter when she was attacked for her weight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Jenelle Evans, a star from Teen Mom was one of the attackers.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-187557" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/i1r2KnSCfHm4MfEgtnH3.png" alt="" width="647" height="665" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/i1r2KnSCfHm4MfEgtnH3.png 480w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/i1r2KnSCfHm4MfEgtnH3-292x300.png 292w" sizes="(max-width: 647px) 100vw, 647px" /></p>
<p>She posted a before-and-after photo of the actor and his wife on the beach.</p>
<p>The photos show how the couple has gained weight over the years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Jenelle captioned the photo saying, &#8220;This is us&#8221; with her husband David Eason.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-187558" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AVu6GGBPzeT6Y9jdproF.png" alt="" width="595" height="295" /></p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t like the comparison. He said that they did not look that fat.</p>
<p>Janelle replied with a laugh. They were slapped with a temporary ban by Facebook after facing intense backlash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Random strangers are not the only ones who comment on Keely&#8217;s weight.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187559" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KlWNYBqIxR4mqZq6IXej.png" alt="" width="1024" height="771" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KlWNYBqIxR4mqZq6IXej.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KlWNYBqIxR4mqZq6IXej-300x226.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/KlWNYBqIxR4mqZq6IXej-768x578.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a topic for their friends.</p>
<p>When asked how he feels about Keely changing her weight in an interview, he <a href="https://www.mediabites.com.pk/12-Aug-2021/hollywood-actor-pierce-brosnan-and-his-wife-then-and-now" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>, &#8220;Friends offered her surgery to reduce her weight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He was against this because he loves her body the way it is.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187560" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ilDCv3CunbberptEEb0i.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ilDCv3CunbberptEEb0i.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ilDCv3CunbberptEEb0i-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ilDCv3CunbberptEEb0i-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ilDCv3CunbberptEEb0i-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ilDCv3CunbberptEEb0i-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;I strongly love every curve of her body&#8230; She is the most beautiful woman in my eyes&#8230; And also because she had our five children&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>He continued:</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187561" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dUpi5QMacEiURyZx1nW1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dUpi5QMacEiURyZx1nW1.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dUpi5QMacEiURyZx1nW1-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dUpi5QMacEiURyZx1nW1-768x402.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;In the past, I truly loved her for her person, not only for her beauty, and now I’m loving her even more than she is my children’s mother,&#8221; he continued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="xl:mt-12 mt-[30px] font-montserrat font-semibold px-3.5 xl:px-0 text-gray-700 leading-7 xl:leading-30px text-lg xl:text-xl">&#8220;And I am very proud of her, and I always seek to be worthy of her love.”</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-187562" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Pierce-Brosnan-Always-Has-His-Wifes-Back-When-Trolls-Attack-Her-Weight_3.gif" alt="" width="535" height="508" /></p>
<p>Awwww. You&#8217;re crying, we&#8217;re not!</p>
<p>She is one lucky lady. She has a husband and father who is very protective of her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>People are put on a pedestal by their partners.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-187563" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-442.png" alt="" width="636" height="799" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-442.png 636w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-442-239x300.png 239w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" /></p>
<p>Having someone who will always have our backs is all we can hope for.</p>
<p>If this isn&#8217;t true love at its best, I don&#8217;t know what is.</p>
