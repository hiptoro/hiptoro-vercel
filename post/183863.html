			<p>When you give someone a present, it is the thought behind it that matters not the cost of the gift. Though, some people think differetly. The cost of the present tells how much you value a person or love them,, especially when you know what other friends and family members are spending on the presents.</p>
<p>One redditor, who username is u/MerryChristmasAA,  shared a detailed opinion of what she felt about the oresent she recieved from her husband. Also, she talks about every other present that her husband brought for others and what was the diffrence in the cost of them. Well, let&#8217;s just put it this way, that the difference of price between hers and other presents was very vast. One thing led to another and the couple got into a hot argument.</p>
<p>The wife got called “an ungrateful, spoiled brat” and she turned to the AITA subreddit for getting a final verdict on her actions. She wanted to know whether whar she did was right or wrong, and what would people have done if they were in her spot. Scroll down for the full story.</p>

<p>The story got over 17.3k upvotes in two days on the AITA online community. Most of teh reaction recieved on the story were in favour of th wife, and stated the man wrong.</p>
<p>It does not matter who was right or wrong, what matters is that no one like to fight with their partners. Alex Scot, a relationship expert explains that couples need to get over the post-argument-hangover to maintian the love and connection. There are several wasy in which you can make an effort to maintain the spice of your relationship with your partner. Communication, self-time, closeness, and being playful are a few suggestion from the relationship coach and expert.</p>
<p>“I recommend physical touch in the form of a hug or a 6-second kiss, the reason for this is co-regulation,” the expert told Hiptoro.</p>
<p>“[Co-regulation is] how we self soothe as infants; a baby cries and a caregiver comes to cuddle and soothe the baby. As adults, co-regulation is very powerful and something we can use to our advantage. So even though you may not feel like hugging or kissing your partner post-argument, as soon as you can bring yourself to do so, go for it. Your nervous system will thank you as it regulates with your partner’s nervous system by sensing their heart rate and breathing,” she explained further.</p>
<p>Alex also noted that she believes the old adage that ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder’ is also something that we should keep in mind. We need some time alone in our day-to-day lives.</p>
<p>“When we take time to ourselves, we are meeting our own needs, feeling autonomous, and it allows us time to miss our partner. Without regular alone time within our relationships, we can become drained and even resentful,” she explained to Hiptoro.</p>
<p>“For some reason, we step into adulthood, get into long-term relationships and believe we must ‘adult’ now and get serious, which leads us to denying ourselves of playtime. To get that spark back, go do something new together, play a game together, or revisit a nostalgic spot or activity.”</p>
