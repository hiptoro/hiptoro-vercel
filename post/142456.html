			<h2>What would you do if you had to choose between your dogs and your partner?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You might find this question ridiculous but it is not. It’s because a </span><span style="font-weight: 400">lady named Liz Haslam had to make a choice between her partner and dogs. Actually, Liz loved taking care of dogs and this is what gave her true happiness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We know you are pretty excited to know about this whole story. So what are you waiting for? Scroll down. </span></p>
<h2>So, let’s get to the story now. It started off with Liz getting married to a guy who she thought is the love of her life. Below is the picture of Liz and her Partner.</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Liz met the love of her life, she was 16-years-old. After Liz and Mike completed high school, they got married and moved to </span><span style="font-weight: 400">the English countryside in a 2 bedroom house. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although both of them were in love, although they had been married for 25 years, although they have a child named Ollie, they still got separated. </span></p>
<h2>“Moment of decision”</h2>

<p>“My husband said: It’s either the dogs or me.” Since that moment I have neither seen nor heard from him, she said.</p>
<h2>Ever since Liz was a little girl, she had an immense love for dogs!</h2>

<p>“I thought that, after 25 years, he should’ve known that giving up dogs was not a part of my intentions, not at all. He knew from the moment we got married what I was all about. I don’t know what he expected,” Liz said.</p>

<p>“We drifted apart. He was very busy with work, and he didn’t give me a chance. I didn’t want to be the woman married to a workaholic, so I took refuge in those who gave me love: my dogs,” Liz explained.</p>
