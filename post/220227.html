			<p>A strange thing happened to Avatar fans soon after the movie came out in 2009. Some of them said they were left feeling very sad.</p>
<p>The science-fiction epic, which is getting a sequel this week, takes place on the lush, beautiful, and made-up moon Pandora, where blue-skinned people called Na-vi live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Watch the trailer for Avatar 2 below.</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.hiptoro.com/p/avatar-2-release-date-and-cast-update-every-confirmed-detail-so-far/">Avatar</a> was a huge success. It made $3 billion at the box office and was nominated for nine Oscars, of which it won three.</p>
<p>But not long after it came out in theaters, it turned out that some fans were left sad.</p>
<p>A source said in 2010 that fans of the movie were sad because they wanted to go to the made-up world of Pandora but knew they could never do so.</p>
<p>Avatar Forums, a website for fans, had a thread called ‘Ways to cope with the depression of the dream of Pandora being intangible’ that gathered more than 1,000 posts. It was so popular that the site&#8217;s administrator, Philippe Baghdassarian, had to start a new one to keep up with the demand of sad Avatar fans.</p>

<p>Baghdassarian said,</p>
<blockquote><p>I wasn&#8217;t depressed myself. In fact the movie made me happy. But I can understand why it made people depressed.</p>
<p>The movie was so beautiful and it showed something we don&#8217;t have here on Earth. I think people saw we could be living in a completely different world and that caused them to be depressed.</p></blockquote>
<p>One post read,</p>
<blockquote><p>That&#8217;s all I have been doing as of late, searching the Internet for more info about &#8216;Avatar.&#8217; I guess that helps. It&#8217;s so hard I can&#8217;t force myself to think that it&#8217;s just a movie, and to get over it, that living like the Na&#8217;vi will never happen. I think I need a rebound movie.</p></blockquote>
<p>On another fan forum, one man said they had even thought about killing themselves, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ever since I went to see &#8216;Avatar&#8217; I have been depressed. Watching the wonderful world of Pandora and all the Na&#8217;vi made me want to be one of them. I can&#8217;t stop thinking about all the things that happened in the film and all of the tears and shivers I got from it.</p>
<p>I even contemplate suicide thinking that if I do it I will be rebirthed in a world similar to Pandora and the everything is the same as in Avatar.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max Perrin, who didn&#8217;t see the movie Avatar until 2017, told a source that he and a lot of other fans felt sad after seeing it.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<blockquote><p>A lot of people have experienced this in the community. It really made me rethink a few things. I had no idea that I could be so deeply influenced by something like this. I had no idea just how deeply it was going to change me.</p></blockquote>
