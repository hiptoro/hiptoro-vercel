			<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A lady encountered a heart-touching incident at </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Vienna&#8217;s Schoenbrunn Zoo and is sharing her experience with everyone via Facebook. After this, her story was picked up by Boobie Babies, a Facebook page. And it caught the eye of so many people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shared a picture of breastfeeding her child while a female orangutan sitting close to the glass, gazing at them. Awww!</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Today I got feeding support from the most unlikely of places. The most surreal moment of my life that had me in tears,</em>&#8221; Copeland wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>I visited Schoenbrunn zoo in Vienna whilst on a mini-break with my partner and son. We nipped in to see the orangutans at the end of our day who were happily playing in the enclosure. So I went to the window for a closer look. And sat down by the window so my lb could see the orangutan who was roughly 5/6ft away. She then got up, carried a piece of cloth to the window, and sat down with me. She looked directly into my eyes then placed her hand up as if to touch my son. I was in awe of this beautiful creature already.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p data-inc="2">&#8220;<em>My son wanted to feed and as it was quiet I fed him whilst I sat there. The way the orangutan reacted took my breath away she kept looking at me, then my son then back again,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;She sat with me for approximately half an hour, kept stroking the glass, and lay down next to me as if to support and protect me.<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>I had to share this because my mind was blown. We may be a species apart but breastfeeding connected us today in a once-in-a-lifetime moment that will stay with me forever. I&#8217;m also incredibly lucky that my partner caught all of this on video</em> ?&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the story where a </span><span style="font-weight: 400">gorilla being taught to breastfeed by women</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, the Facebook page thought about starting </span><span style="font-weight: 400">an organization dedicated to supporting breastfeeders:</span></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Did you know that women from La Leche League once taught a mother gorilla to breastfeed? The Mamma gorilla had been born and raised in captivity and didn&#8217;t know what to do with her firstborn, and her baby sadly died. When she next became pregnant, breastfeeding women volunteered to sit beside the gorilla&#8217;s enclosure and breastfeed their babies, showing the gorilla what to do. When the gorilla gave birth, a volunteer came over and breastfed her baby, showing Mamma gorilla what to do, step by step. Mamma gorilla watched, and then copied, and went on to successfully feed her baby</em> <img decoding="async" src="https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t6c/1/16/2764.png" alt="" />&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surprisingly, this adorable story got shared by </span><span style="font-weight: 400">more than 37,000 times. Also, so many people expressed their thought expressing how beautiful and moving it was. Some people also express their sadness thinking about the life of animals that are captured as a captive in the zoo. </span></p>
