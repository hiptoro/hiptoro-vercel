			<p>Women have always been very inspiring in our lives. You can be inspired by your mother, sister or wife. It is not like you need a strong woman icon to inspire you. Although you might have felt seeing a woman that she is someone you can idolize. But it is totally up to you about who do you think has created an impact on you. Well recently, a Reddit user u/xanthopants asked men to share about who is their female hero. While most men would not have a female role model. But there were few men who were frank and courageous about answering the user. Below is a list of what they shared, so let&#8217;s jump on to knowing some real life female heroes.</p>
<h2 id="post0" class="open-list-header">#1 Yosefzai Malala</h2>
<figure id="attachment_140707" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140707" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-140707 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-69.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="530" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-69.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-69-300x227.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140707" class="wp-caption-text">Yosefzai Malala. Had more courage than all the men in her village put together. As a child she stood up to the Taliban, looked one their members straight in the eye and told them they can f!@# right off if they think they can stop women from getting an education. She took an AK-47 round to the face for it and still continues her fight today. That same year Caitlin Jenner was voted woman of the year which still pisses me off.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="post1" class="open-list-header">#2 Hedy Lamarr</h2>
<figure id="attachment_140708" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140708" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-140708 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-70.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="677" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-70.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-70-300x290.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140708" class="wp-caption-text">Hedy Lamarr, she was basically a female Bruce Wayne. She was a hardcore engineer, scientist, model, actress, linguist, entertainer, and humanitarian. At the same time as she was one of the highest paid actresses in the world and considered one of the most beautiful women in the world, she was engineering secret ground-breaking tech IN HER TRAILER between scenes. She invented frequency hopping that was used to target submarines and enforce the blockade of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis and help prevent Armageddon&#8230; it’s also part of how GPS, Bluetooth, and WiFi work. One of the best stories about her is that some rich dude was hitting on her by telling her he could get her on a Concord flight but she turned him down saying “a woman can fly faster without a man dragging her down”&#8230; then called the engineers and helped improve the design to make it faster and more stable. She was a prolific inventor, creating new items like fluorescent pet collars, proximity fuses, food flavorings, and other items until she died in 2000.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="post2" class="open-list-header">#3 Harriet Tubman</h2>
<figure id="attachment_140709" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140709" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-140709 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-68.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="743" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-68.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-68-283x300.jpg 283w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140709" class="wp-caption-text">Harriet Tubman. Tiny, 5 ft tall, illiterate former slave, who was a spy for the north, worked as a battle strategist and freed over 300 slaves.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="post3" class="open-list-header">#4 Elizabeth Friedman</h2>
<figure id="attachment_140710" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140710" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-140710 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-68.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="760" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-68.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-68-276x300.jpg 276w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140710" class="wp-caption-text">Elizabeth Friedman was a badass mathematical genius who used her code breaking skills to help bring down some of the biggest mobsters in the 1930’s while they were busy running circles around law enforcement. More importantly, she was responsible for breaking up Nazi spy rings in the 1940’s, particularly in South America, and helped turn the tide of major conflicts that very possibly shifted the outcome of World War II. And she did all of it while being mocked, dismissed, and forced to keep her work secret by order of the government. Nobody knew her contributions in taking down the Nazis until after she died and her work was declassified. Everyone should know this amazing woman who sought neither accolades nor credit for doing what her male counterparts couldn’t even begin to comprehend.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="post4" class="open-list-header">#5 Sophie Scholl</h2>
<figure id="attachment_140712" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140712" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-140712 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-67.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="701" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-67.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-67-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-67-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-67-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140712" class="wp-caption-text">Sophie Scholl, active member of a non-violent resistance group against Nazi Germany. If I remember correctly, she was executed for distributing pamphlets promoting her cause. She stood up for others even in the face of death. I deeply admire that.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="post5" class="open-list-header">#6 Marie Curie</h2>
<figure id="attachment_140714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140714" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-140714 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/6-68.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="757" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/6-68.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/6-68-277x300.jpg 277w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140714" class="wp-caption-text">Marie Curie. FEARLESSLY diving into the unknown, using the machine her husband had invented, discovering and recording knowledge that benefits us all today&#8230;at the cost of her very Life. The truest type of explorer there is. There should be statues of her at every nuclear facility, hospital and public park for what she has done, and lost, on our behalf.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="post6" class="open-list-header">#7 Constance Tipper</h2>
<figure id="attachment_140719" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140719" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-140719 size-full" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/7-66.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="723" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/7-66.jpg 700w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/7-66-290x300.jpg 290w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-140719" class="wp-caption-text">Constance Tipper. She is an absolute unsung hero in materials science. During WW2 the US began the astonishing all welded &#8216;liberty ship&#8217; program which had never been done before to supply the UK with essential supplies. Problem was some of the ships would CATASTROPHICALLY (and at times fatally) break in half out of nowhere (the photos are astonishing) Many feared it was the welds and almost stopped the program which would have been catastrophic for supplying the UK in need. Tipper managed to prove it was in fact the type of steel they were using was going through a ductile-brittle transition (Below a certain temp the steel was incredibly brittle and in the cold waters of the atlantic combined with the twisting of the waves it would snap ships in two out of nowhere.) The test she developed is to this day known as the &#8220;Tipper Test&#8221; and still used. Thus her work saved the liberty ship program and kept Britain supplied.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="post7" class="open-list-header">#8 Dolly Parton</h2>

She&#8217;s brilliant, brave, determined, and generous. Her charity work is incredible. And she&#8217;s quite progressive *when that&#8217;s not her cultural background*&#8211;I admire anyone who had to think out their views and go against the grain, much more than someone who has &#8220;perfect&#8221; politics because those views got approval in their community.</figcaption></figure>

A black bisexual woman in the 1940s and she basically pioneered the way we play the electric guitar today. She inspired Johnny Cash, Elvis and she even put Little Richard on stage for the first time. IMO she deserves to be a household name.</figcaption></figure>
