			<p>Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes will not be on American TV screens when people wake up any time soon.</p>
<p>In a memo sent to staff on December 12 and obtained by a source, ABC News president Kim Godwin said that the co-anchors of GMA3: What You Need to Know, who were recently replaced as co-hosts of the Good Morning America spin-off, &#8220;will remain off-air pending the completion of an internal review&#8221; because there were rumors that they were dating.</p>
<blockquote><p>I understand that the continuing coverage can be distracting from the incredibly important work our team does here at ABC News,</p></blockquote>
<p>Godwin wrote in the memo that &#8220;anchors at GMA3 will be swapped out for the time being.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added,</p>
<blockquote><p>It is my hope that we will continue to focus our energy on what we do best, and I want all of you to know how immensely proud I am of your hard work and professionalism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since Dec. 5, Robach and Holmes have not been at GMA3. During their time away, ABC&#8217;s Gio Benitez and Stephanie Ramos have been co-hosting the daytime show in their place.</p>
<p>Earlier in November, a source published a video of Robach, 49, and Holmes, 45, getting close to each other in Upstate New York. This led to rumors that the two were having a relationship behind the scenes. Soon after pictures from their trip were posted online, both of the co-hosts shut down their Instagram accounts.</p>
<p>Robach has been married to Andrew Shue, who used to be on Melrose Place, since 2010. She has two daughters from a previous marriage, and she is also the stepmother to Shue&#8217;s three children with his ex-wife, Jennifer Hageney.</p>
<p>In 2010, Holmes got married to lawyer Marilee Fiebig. They have a daughter together, Sabine, who is 9 years old. Holmes also has two older kids of his own.</p>

<p>Neither anchor has talked about the dating rumors in public, but Holmes did seem to joke about having a busy week after the photos were posted online.</p>
<blockquote><p>You know, it&#8217;s too bad it&#8217;s Friday. It&#8217;s been a great week.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the December 3 episode of GMA3, he said something that made Robach say, &#8220;Speak for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robach added,</p>
<blockquote><p>I am very excited about the weekend, and I&#8217;m sure everyone else is too. We all love our Fridays around here—some of us do at least.</p></blockquote>
