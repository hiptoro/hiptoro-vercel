			<p>Celine Dion talked openly about moving on with her career after her husband&#8217;s passing. Since René Angélil&#8217;s passing, the 51-year-old has kept busy, but she recently admitted that she isn&#8217;t quite ready to move on with someone new.</p>

<p>The singer revealed in an interview with CBS News that even years after her husband&#8217;s death, she is still in love with him.</p>
<p>“I love. I love. I love him. I’m still in love with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The five-time Grammy winner also stated to Today that she is not prepared for a love relationship. I never date. I&#8217;m not prepared to date yet. I&#8217;m fortunate and grateful to be around by so many people who can make me laugh, but I miss being touched,&#8221; she remarked.</p>
<p>“I miss to be hugged. I missed to be told, ‘You’re beautiful.’ I miss what a boyfriend and I miss what a husband would do.”</p>

<p>A heart attack, unfortunately, claimed Angélil&#8217;s life in 2016. Dion&#8217;s manager since she was 12 years old was Angélil. However, until Dion was much older, the two did not develop a romantic relationship.</p>
<p>Without the guy who directed her life for so long and assisted in her ascent to fame, Dion said in an interview with GMA that she is &#8220;learning to make her own decisions, taking on new ventures and eventually finding confidence again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dion claims that she is likely to continue mourning her spouse forever, though. Dion added, &#8220;I believe I will most likely be in mourning for the rest of my life,&#8221; to The Sun. But she said, optimistically,</p>
<p>“Rene has prepared me for all my life since I’m 12. I have never met another man in my life, never kissed another man in my life. I miss him a lot. I miss him a lot — for my partner, for the man I was embracing, kissing, and making love with. My worries, my dreams &#8230;”</p>
