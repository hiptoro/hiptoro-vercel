			<p>People know Adam Sandler for his unique sense of humor. He is probably one of the biggest comedy stars starting out on ‘Saturday Night Live’ and going on to become one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood.</p>
<p>But did you know that he credits his success to his wife? His wife was also an actress but now likes to stay behind the scene. Well, we are talking about Jackie Sandler whom Adam met on the set of the 1999 movie Big Daddy and then married in 2003.</p>

<p>It was Jackie’s second movie role after transitioning from modeling and had just appeared in her first movie Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo where she’d played the small part of Sally.</p>
<p>Although it was only a bit part as a waitress for the then Jacqueline Samantha Titone, it ended up leading to a major part of marriage to the rising star Adam Sandler.</p>

<p>Adam Sandler’s wedding Jackie converted to Adam’s religion of Judaism and the two got married in June 2003. Sandler, who was 36 when he tied the knot with Jackie, had a special guest as ring bearer and best man – his bulldog Meatball.</p>
<p>They have two daughters Sadie and Sunny and when they’re not devoting their time to their children they’re supporting each other’s careers.</p>
<p>Appearing on the Ellen DeGeneres show with Drew Barrymore in 2014 he was asked about the many love scenes the two have shared and Sandler was quick to point out the encouragement he receives from his wife during those scenes.</p>
<p>“It’s like the best thing that my wife loves Drew so much that she encourages me! There’s no jealousy at all. She’s just like, ‘Get in there!’” he laughed.</p>

<p>“And I’m walking away and I just see my wife like shaking her head, and she says, ‘Just please, for the sake of women, get in there and just look a little more alive!”</p>

<p>Sandler often casts his wife in his movies, many through his own production company Happy Madison Productions, with the two appearing in 50 First Dates, Just Go With It, Little Nicky, Grown Ups, and Grown Ups 2.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185310" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-26.jpg" alt="" width="682" height="1024" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-26.jpg 682w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/5-26-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Adam Sandler’s youngest daughter, Sunny, also had supporting roles in his films. She played in That’s My Boy, and Jack and Jill. The now 13-year-old also voiced several characters, including the ones in the Hotel Transylvania series.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sandler credits his wife with giving him the encouragement to move out of his comfort zone telling Ellen in 2019 that when he was sent the script to play a gambling addict in crime drama Uncut Gems it was his wife who pushed him to take it.&#8221;<img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-185311" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6-4.png" alt="" width="865" height="670" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6-4.png 865w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6-4-300x232.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/6-4-768x595.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 865px) 100vw, 865px" /></p>
<p>“I read it, I loved the movie, but I was scared to do it. Then I asked Jackie to read it.</p>
<p>“We do this together, me and Jackie, we discuss what I’m going to do, and she gives me strength and courage to jump into this stuff,” he said.</p>
<p>“You know when your wife’s not the happiest she’s ever been or husband, and it’s good to [talk it out]. Just an hour of hanging out together makes us rocking again,” he told ET Canada.</p>

<p>“If I feel the energy of ‘I can’t stand you, Adam,’ I say ‘Come on, let’s head down the road, let’s get you something and we’re sitting, just talking. I’ll just listen to [Jackie] talk about anything [she] wants to talk about.”</p>
<p>As for marriage advice, Sandler had some very smart and simple tips. “Just getting time together,” he told reporters at the Toronto International Film Festival, according to Closer Weekly.</p>
<p>“Making sure that you don’t run off too long and hanging out together and telling the truth and that kind of thing’s good.”</p>
