			<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Things have become really tough and we have grown busy. To make the ends meet, we are always working and it is good. But it is also a nice idea to stay back and appreciate the cute things. Like a dog that never fails to fill our lives with paw-sitivity and paw-someness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are around dogs, you are one of the luckiest persons in the world. It&#8217;s because dogs are a gift to humans straight from heaven. We mean look at their innocence, their little puppy eyes, their wagging tail, and their constant love for food. Oh yes, food. A dog wants to eat everything that you are eating and wants to play with you all the time. Also, you can’t say no to your furry friend. It’s because he will look straight into your soul and give you a guilt trip. Do you want that? No? So don’t ever say no to your cute furry angel. </span></p>
