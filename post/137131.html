			<p>Meet Panda, the 2-year-old rescued kitty who’s also is an unusual but extraordinary babysitter. From the time her human became pregnant, she has always been protective of her. Today, with little Sean born, Panda is entirely dedicated to him.</p>
<p><em>“Once I got pregnant she began following me throughout the house, tucking her head on my belly, purring,”</em> stated Assayag. <em>“Now, 3 months later, she jumps on the bed next to him, smells him, sits close to him. You can clearly see she adores him from the beginning!”</em></p>
<h2>This is Panda, the 2-year-old adopted cat who’s also an unusual yet utterly cute babysitter</h2>
