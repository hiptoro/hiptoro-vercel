			<p>Jared Fogle hates his life in prison.</p>
<p>Fogle appeared in advertisements for Subway. He was able to start his career when he became a household figure.</p>
<p>He was found guilty of one count of distribution and receipt of child pornography as well as one count of traveling to engage in unlawful sexual activity with a minor. Fogle was sentenced to 15 years and eight months for his crimes.</p>
<p>In 2007, Fogle told a reporter that he was attracted to middle school girls. 400 child-porn movies were found after investigations.</p>
<p>In August 2015, Fogle pled guilty to child pornography and paying for sex with a minor. Fourteen of his victims were granted more than one million dollars.</p>
<p>Since he was sentenced to more than a decade and a half in prison, Fogle&#8217;s ideas have not come to fruition. He says that he hates his life behind bars.</p>
<p>While in prison, Fogle wrote a letter in which he expressed his displeasure with the way in which he was treated by both prison staff and other inmates.</p>
<p>“We don’t have a lot of control over our daily lives in prison, but working out is one of the things I can control.”</p>
<p>It states that being locked up in a cell has been difficult for him. He says that his life in prison is very difficult because he is in better health now than he was before.</p>
<p>Fogle and the other inmates would watch football. He uses his free time to keep his health and body in shape through physical activities such as sports and exercise.</p>
<div class="BEQ5qRGHkYh1hxbZfslPg _2NfC9QwT5vroDJb34ockAK">
<p>“I feel really good physically and mentally.”</p>
<h2></h2>
</div>
<div class="BEQ5qRGHkYh1hxbZfslPg _2NfC9QwT5vroDJb34ockAK">Lawyers for Fogle sent a letter to the court. Fogle asked for forgiveness. He says sorry in the letter, even though he doesn&#8217;t seem to be able to fully take responsibility for his actions.</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div class="BEQ5qRGHkYh1hxbZfslPg _2NfC9QwT5vroDJb34ockAK">
<p>He wrote:</p>
</div>
<div class="BEQ5qRGHkYh1hxbZfslPg _2NfC9QwT5vroDJb34ockAK">
<p>“I realize I royally screwed up to wind up where I am. I was selfish and entitled. I think about all the people I’ve let down every single day, especially my family. All I can do is learn from my stupid mistakes to be a better man when I get released in a few years.”</p>
</div>
<div class="BEQ5qRGHkYh1hxbZfslPg _2NfC9QwT5vroDJb34ockAK">
<p>There are things outside the prison that he misses. He said, “Prison takes away so much, but I really miss the small things like walking barefoot on the carpet, sleeping on a nice comfy mattress, eating with real silverware, and having access to a microwave.”</p>
</div>
<div class="BEQ5qRGHkYh1hxbZfslPg _2NfC9QwT5vroDJb34ockAK">Fogle will be eligible for parole for the first time in 2029 when he will have served 85% of his sentence. It&#8217;s not clear if the court will want Fogle to serve more time behind bars than the law allows.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>What do you think about the case against Fogle? Is it a good idea to give him more time behind bars?</div>
