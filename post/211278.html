			<p>Even Charlize Theron, who has been nominated for an Academy Award and has starred in some of the most successful movies of the 21st century, has a difficult time getting movies produced in her career. The actress disclosed in a recent interview with Harper&#8217;s Bazaar that she does not believe she has attained the pinnacle of Hollywood stardom and opened up about the potential missed business opportunities as a result of this perception.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m at a place where it is what it is,” Theron said. “Working more isn’t, I think, going to change my level of fame. It just has always been a mediocre ride. I’ve never been one of those people that’s at a Kim Kardashian level. But I feel like it’s just always been this thing.”</p>
<p>She mentioned that acquiring funding for the films that she wants to direct has become a significantly more challenging task for her. The actor who played Mad Max in &#8220;Fury Road&#8221; thinks that this is due in part to a decline in fame and in part to the fact that the industry now considers a wider variety of factors in addition to star power when evaluating potential projects.</p>
<h6></h6>
<p>“I will say, back in the day, it used to be like, you want to have some of this fame so you can go make the shit that you really want to make,” she said. “But now it’s like, I pitch shit all day long and people are like, ‘No, thanks.’ I’m like, ‘I guess that’s not cash in the bank anymore.’ And that’s nice. It’s nice that you’re making things on the merit of how good they are versus this idea of, like, ‘Oh, you’re this thing, and we want to be in business with that thing.’”</p>
<p>Theron is not resting on her laurels, as evidenced by the fact that she will next be seen in the sequels &#8220;Fast X&#8221; and &#8220;The Old Guard 2.&#8221; The famous actress has stated that she is highly motivated to keep working and to make use of her platform to advocate for better working conditions for aspiring young actresses who are just beginning their careers.</p>
<p>“There’s a natural fight in me to want to create environments that feel like the things that I wish I had 30 years ago when I started,” she said.</p>
