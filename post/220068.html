			<p>When Tom Brady&#8217;s team lost on Sunday, he was so upset that he almost forgot his family was in the stadium.</p>
<p>On this week&#8217;s episode of his SiriusXM podcast Let&#8217;s Go! with Tom Brady, Larry Fitzgerald, and Jim Gray, the star quarterback talked about Tampa Bay&#8217;s &#8220;tough loss on the road&#8221; to the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
<blockquote><p>We got our ass kicked,</p></blockquote>
<p>Brady, who grew up in the Bay Area, said this about the big loss. The NFL star was so upset about losing 35-7 that he forgot that about 100 friends and family members were at the game to watch him play.</p>
<p>He revealed,</p>
<blockquote><p>I was walking from the locker room to the bus — a kind of long walk of 500 yards or so — and just as I got to the bus the woman who I was with said, &#8216;Hey, didn&#8217;t you want to see your family?&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>So I turned around and walked back.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brady was surprised to find that some of his family members had stayed to watch the loss.</p>
<blockquote><p>And at least after the game I got to see my sisters, nieces and some cousins. My parents left in the third quarter, thankfully, to get home.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brady said that his team lost because they couldn&#8217;t &#8220;do anything the way we needed to in order to win.&#8221;</p>

<p>The 49ers have the best defense in the NFL right now, and Brady said that he &#8220;was responsible for two of the turnovers&#8221; that led to the loss.</p>
<blockquote><p>I missed Mike [Evans] open in the end zone for a touchdown,</p></blockquote>
<p>Brady explained.</p>
<blockquote><p>Missed Scotty [Miller] down the field. So, you know, just look at myself and realize I gotta do a lot better than that in order to win.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers star also said that &#8220;this time of year&#8221; brings &#8220;a lot of things&#8221; that can &#8220;take your attention away from where it needs to be.&#8221; Going forward, he wants to keep doing what he&#8217;s doing:</p>
<blockquote><p>just gonna keep battling,</p></blockquote>
<p>said Brady.</p>
<p>At this point in the season, Brady&#8217;s Buccaneers are below .500, which he said, &#8220;feels terrible.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>I just think there&#8217;s an intense level of urgency that everyone&#8217;s gotta feel. And you got four games left in the season and everything&#8217;s ahead of us. We&#8217;re below .500. That feels horrible the way that we lost yesterday.</p></blockquote>
<p>This week, as they get ready to play the 9-4 Cincinnati Bengals, Brady wants to &#8220;come in with a great sense of determination and discipline to get better,&#8221; he said.</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a singular focus on how I can do my job in the best possible way.</p></blockquote>

<p>Brady does better on the field when he puts his feelings into the game. He told the crowd that there is &#8220;one emotion&#8221; he always tries to find during a game, and that is anger.</p>
<p>Brady said that he is a &#8220;pretty calm&#8221; person &#8220;by nature.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>But anger is the one emotion that works for me,</p></blockquote>
<p>admitted Brady.</p>
<blockquote><p>So when I don&#8217;t feel it and you guys see me [saying], you know, &#8216;Motherf&#8211;ker,&#8217; that is in trying to get me going.&#8217;ady</p></blockquote>
