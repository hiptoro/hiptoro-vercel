			<p>The United States went back in time half a century ago. The Supreme Court overruled it. There is no national law that protects women&#8217;s reproductive rights. More than half of them have a plan to ban abortion completely.</p>
<p>Women in the United States are speaking up about the consequences of the decision as well as their own experiences demonstrating that abortion should be considered a fundamental right.</p>
<p>Many celebrities have talked about having abortions and what it was like. These women had consequences to deal with, such as being judged by other people and dealing with their own thoughts. They did it, no matter if it was legal or not.</p>

<p>I am very thankful that I was able to have an abortion. The sexual abuser who is a Kentuckian, as am I, and I reside in Tennessee, has the right to have children. I would have had to co-parent.</p>

<p>When I was 14 years old, I found out I was pregnant. I didn&#8217;t talk to anyone, I panicked, I was in the hot baths, and I drank something like Johnnie Walker Red with a little bit of Clorox, alcohol, baking soda, and some sort of cream, which probably saved my stomach. You put it all together. I got sick.</p>

3. Billie Jean King.</h2>

<p>In the early &#8217;70s, if you wanted an abortion, you had to tell a panel of strangers why you thought the baby would hurt your health. One of the most degrading experiences of my life was being lectured to a dozen or so people about why I qualified for an abortion.</p>
<h2>
4. Laura Prepon.</h2>

<p>The brain and bones were not growing according to the specialist. My body was at risk of carrying any longer if the pregnancy did not go to full term. We had to end the baby&#8217;s life.</p>
<h2>
5. Busy Philipps.</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s not brave for me to say I had an abortion at 15 because it&#8217;s a medical thing, a choice that I made, and I don&#8217;t regret it at all. I don&#8217;t have shame because this shame was perpetrated on me. I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t have that baby. I&#8217;m OK&#8230; We hold on to these things so as to not make men uncomfortable, but I&#8217;m ready for them to start holding it.</p>

6. Gloria Steinem.</h2>

<p>I was in London waiting for my visa because I had a fellowship in India. I was living in London and working as a waitress to support myself. If I went horseback riding, or if I threw myself down the stairs, I would have terminated my pregnancy. It was sheer luck to go to a doctor whose name I found in the telephone book. He looked at me and said, &#8220;If you promise never to tell anyone my name, I will help you. I was sent to a woman doctor who did the procedure.</p>

<p>I had an abortion while I was on tour. The abortion pill was given to me there. It was easy. Everyone deserves that kind of access.</p>

<p>I support this message because I had an abortion. I don&#8217;t think you should be ashamed. Most of the individuals who decide to have early abortions are now moms. I was on anti-conception medication and it didn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>My abortion has been a secret for a long time. I&#8217;m 51 years of age, and I am sharing it with you from the home where I have brought up my three kids, who are my unparalleled delight. &#8230;I didn&#8217;t have the means to provide a stable home for myself when I was just starting out in my career. As a family, we decided that it was the right choice to end the baby&#8217;s life. My heart was broken. &#8230; I didn&#8217;t complain. I felt I deserved the pain because I had been so ashamed.</p>
<h2>
10. Stevie Nicks.</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure there wouldn&#8217;t have been a band if I hadn&#8217;t had an abortion. I couldn&#8217;t have had a child because we worked so hard and there were a lot of drugs and I would have had to leave because I was doing a lot of drugs. I knew that the music we were going to bring to the world was going to make people happy and heal their hearts. You know what? That&#8217;s important. There is only one band in the world that has two lead women singers and two lead women writers. My world&#8217;s goal was that.</p>

<p>I was told that I had to be awake for the whole procedure after I went into pre-term labor. It was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. I still have nightmares about it. I was powerless and alone. When I think about the fact that women might have to face abortions in worse conditions than I did, my stomach turns.</p>

<p>I had an abortion when I was younger. It was the best decision I could have made for myself, my boyfriend, and the unborn fetus. I was born into a cycle of poverty and chaos and having a baby at that time would have perpetuated it.</p>

<p>I was a teenager when I thought I was going to die. It was the most difficult thing I had ever gone through. If I said I wasn&#8217;t pro-choice, it wouldn&#8217;t be right. I didn&#8217;t have anything to give the child.</p>

<p>I had a fetus removed when I was young, and it was the best choice I have made. I wasn&#8217;t ready, emotionally, psychologically, and financially for the baby, I didn&#8217;t want. Many lives will be ruined because so many children will end up in foster homes.</p>
