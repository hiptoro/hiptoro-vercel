I was an event manager at a mansion that did a lot of weddings so I&#8217;ve seen my fair share of wedding s***shows.</p>
<p>My favorite is probably the one where the entire wedding party started drinking at noon for a 6pm wedding. The groom passed out around 5 and we couldn&#8217;t get him up. So I made him a a ham sandwich and propped him up in his bed while I handfed him.</p>
<p>Managed to get him and his boys down to the courtyard and then had to run back in and herd the women down. The bride spilled her mimosa all over her dress, two of the bridesmaids couldn&#8217;t find their shoes, but everyone was super happy and nice.</p>
<p>There were about 150 people at the reception and every single one of them got absolutely hammered. The mother of the bride kept sneaking up on me hugging me and the groom made me pose for some photos with them. They also gave me all the leftover wedding cake and a few bottles of wine. I miss them.</p>

My husband&#8217;s brother having a seaside wedding. Our almost 2 year old was the ring bearer. He passed off the rings to the best man (Dad), then toddled away. &#8230;Off the cliff.</p>
<p>It was prob a 60-80&#8242; drop to the beach below, but he luckily got caught up in the bushes, and husband snatched him up. He was buckled into his stroller after that, kamikaze kid.</p>

At the reception, the bride received a tip to go out to the parking lot where she found her new husband making out with his ex gf. The ensuing fight came inside the hall and the party screeched to a halt. Both families were displeased and stuck him with ALOT of bills. We kept our gift.</p>

Bride never showed up.</p>
<p>My cousin was the groom and had about 500 people in attendance. He got on the mic and said there&#8217;s no bride, so we had the party anyway. He married someone else 2 years later</p>

I’ve said this before on here but they didn’t have any tables or chairs.</p>
<p>We had nowhere to sit or to put our plates down. Everyone had to hold their food standing up and put their drinks down on the ground.</p>
<p>Since there were no chairs to make an aisle for her to walk down she just kind of strolled through the crowd while people were confused and talking.</p>
<p>“Where are the chairs?” was the theme of the wedding.</p>
<p>I was a close friend so our group sent me to ask her why there were no tables and chairs and she simply said “Oh you have to pay extra for that.”</p>
<p>????</p>

The sister of the bride who wasn&#8217;t invited showed up drunk and got in a fight with the bride until the father of the bride broke it up by putting the sister in a choke hold and dragging her out of the venue. The bride was surprisingly fine afterwards Source: I&#8217;m a wedding caterer</p>

There was this guy outside of the hotel walking up to groups of people in the smoking area, asking how much each person weighed. He was very overweight himself, and his jeans looked to be on inside out. He was severely underdressed for the occasion, and no one seemed to know him. Anyways, he would ask a persons weight, and then exclaim &#8220;I can bench that!&#8221;. Until one guy (I think he was a family member of the bride) got into an argument with him and started asking around if anyone knew this person, figuring that he was a wedding crasher. That&#8217;s when this gentleman decided to cut a deal with everyone. &#8220;If I can pick up that bench with my bare hands, can I stay for the party?&#8221; To which everyone agrees, because the bench was clearly bolted to the ground. So, he walks over, puts his hands on the bench, crouches down, and with all of his might&#8230; s**ts his pants in front of everyone. He stood up and waddled off through the parking lot to never be seen again. I did hear throughout the night people talking about a guy who was on shrooms outside, trying to lift a bench. So, I guess he was also tripping balls.</p>

Was at a wedding this summer. The groom&#8217;s family absolutely tore their son/brother apart during the speeches. They didn&#8217;t say one loving thing, and went on to talk about all the mistakes he made during this life. The worst thing they brought up was how he was responsible for a car accident that put someone in a coma. I was cringing.</p>

Mother of the groom showed up in white. Bride took her shopping weeks before and thought they had found a blue dress that made MOG look beautiful. I wish to this day I had thought to spill my wine on her and force her to change.</p>

Divorced father of the groom started up about how much better his new wife was compared to his old wife, during his speech.</p>
<p>On and on and the qualities of Asian women vs white women.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never looked at my shoes so hard in my life.</p>

My dad&#8217;s friend&#8217;s son got married when I was a teenager. He&#8217;s a really cool guy and we played Nintendo a lot whenever we visited. Anyway, the embarrassing story is about his bride.</p>
<p>She decided that she wanted to sing to him at one point during the ceremony, so she chose the song, &#8220;Wind Beneath My Wings&#8221; by Bette Midler. Midler is an alto. The bride was a HIGH soprano. Unfortunately, she couldn&#8217;t sing very well, either. So for several minutes she squeaks this song out while he&#8217;s standing there with the most awkward look on his face. I think everyone felt embarrassed. I know I did.</p>
<p>The good thing is that they&#8217;re still happily married and have a daughter.</p>

At my own wedding reception, I saw my wife&#8217;s grandma, who was about 98, very slowly and with a terrible sense of inevitability fall sideways off her chair. She remained in a sitting position but just slooowly tilted sideways til she was on the floor, still in the exact same pose.</p>
<p>It sounds sh**ty but all I could think was &#8220;f**ksake don&#8217;t die at our wedding please don&#8217;t die at our wedding&#8221;</p>
<p>Luckily she was fine, and lived for another few years to see her 100th birthday.</p>

For the bouquet toss, a middle-aged guy forced his middle-aged girlfriend out onto the floor, then stood by her so she couldn&#8217;t leave. The bouquet was caught by an excited little girl. The guy proceeded to yank the bouquet out of the little girl&#8217;s hands, gave it to his middle-aged girlfriend, then ran off the floor cheering loudly to high-five one of his buddies. The little girl ran away crying.</p>

We were partying in Puerto Vallarta, and there was a beautiful wedding going on at the hotel next door. A friend of a friend of mine was pretty drunk, then just sprinted for the wedding. He hopped the wall, blasted through the seating arrangements, then body slammed the like, 6 foot tall wedding cake.</p>
<p>He spent the next two days in Mexican jail, and will forever be a f**king prick in my heart.</p>

Cousin decided to save her first kiss ever for the ceremony. Celibacy taken to the next level. The bride and groom were visibly giddy from nerves throughout the 1 hour prayer-rich ceremony&#8230; And the kiss was the most awkward thing to watch. So much unessesary jaw movement. They both turned beet red and hugged. Too awkward for everyone involved to be cute.</p>

I was an attendant in my best friend&#8217;s wedding. Her father walked her down the aisle and while he was not visibly drunk, he had a hard time walking behind her to sit in the pew. He stepped on her dress ripping it from her back down to her ass (her thong was red). They had to stop the wedding so that she could find safety pins.</p>

Groom got really drunk, trashed the suite, and got tased by the police before being arrested.</p>

I worked at a wedding venue for 4 years.</p>
<p>Having to stop a Bride&#8217;s Stepdad from hitting her over the head with a chair was a highlight. The whole room were just fighting with each other, the best man kicked the Mother in Law.</p>
<p>Different wedding, some d**khead bit the DJ because he refused to play a certain song.</p>
<p>For me the absolute worst one was when the newlyweds were arguing at the end of the night, in front of their young son, she admitted to cheating on him. It all came out there and then in front of his family and he was devestated.</p>

During the &#8220;Man of Honor&#8221; speech, the guy repeatedly said the name of the bride&#8217;s ex instead of her new husband. Three times. &#8220;When I first saw [Bride] and [Bride&#8217;s ex], I knew they were perfect for each other&#8221;. Stuff like that. And he caught himself, too, every time. He was insanely embarrassed&#8230; but he still did it three times throughout the speech.</p>
<p>It was so awkward watching it happen&#8230; probably the biggest social trainwreck I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>

Brother and sister-in-law thought it would be fun to have their dogs walked down the aisle after their flower girl spread the flower petals. The dogs thought mid-way down the aisle was the perfect place for a sh**ting photo-op on the white runner.</p>

After arriving 45 minutes after the ceremony was to begin, during the ring exchange, the groom gets this blank look and says he didn&#8217;t know he was supposed to buy her another ring. SIL slipped off her wedding band and handed it off to the preacher.</p>
