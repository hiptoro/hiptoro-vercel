			<p>Sometimes, being a parent makes you feel like you have superpowers you didn&#8217;t know you had until you need to use them.</p>
<p>Just ask Shaun Cunningham, who went into &#8220;Dad mode&#8221; when a baseball bat went flying toward his son Landon&#8217;s face at a Braves-Pirates game.</p>
<p>The 8-year-old was excited to see his favorite team play and was taking pictures when the bat flew into the stands.</p>
<blockquote><p>I didn’t have a lot of time to think,</p></blockquote>
<p>Shaun<a href="https://www.today.com/parents/meet-hero-dad-who-saved-his-son-being-hit-flying-t78556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> told</a> TODAY.</p>
<blockquote><p>Once I realized it was headed for my son, I just did anything I could to block it and deflect it.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what&#8217;s most surprising is how other people in the crowd jump out of the way of the projectile while Landon&#8217;s dad moves toward it. It paints a beautiful picture of what it means to be a father. Since it happened in 2016, the beautiful moment of a father protecting his child has warmed the hearts of people all over the internet.</p>
<p>Landon will have more than just a baseball game to tell his friends about for a while.</p>
<blockquote><p>My first baseball game was amazing,</p></blockquote>
<p>Landon said.</p>
<p>In the video below, you can see Shaun in full &#8220;Dad mode.&#8221;</p>
