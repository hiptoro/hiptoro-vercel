<p>Young Evan Strackman couldn&#8217;t wait when he learned that his class had a Halloween party. He hurried home and, with the help of his mother, made an incredibly cool Tony Stark costume.</p>
<p>But as Iron Man himself often did, as the days of the big parties rolled, Evan encountered adversity. It turns out that some bullies didn&#8217;t pick up his disguise well, but Evan didn&#8217;t let it stop him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>When you are a child, no holiday compares to Halloween.</h2>

<p>This is the only night of the year where kids are encouraged to dress up, have fun and run crazy! Plus, you get free candies!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Instead of acting like the same old superhero this year, 10-year-old Evan Strackman thought he would try something new.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174544" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qbMqdYmunr88YtcpOP6M.png" alt="" width="2160" height="1622" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qbMqdYmunr88YtcpOP6M.png 2160w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qbMqdYmunr88YtcpOP6M-300x225.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qbMqdYmunr88YtcpOP6M-1024x769.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qbMqdYmunr88YtcpOP6M-768x577.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qbMqdYmunr88YtcpOP6M-1536x1153.png 1536w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/qbMqdYmunr88YtcpOP6M-2048x1538.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2160px) 100vw, 2160px" /></p>
<p>Evan happens to be a big fan of The Avengers, specifically Iron Man. So it only made sense that he&#8217;d look to honor his favorite hero come Halloween.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Evan didn&#8217;t want to complicate things with a temporary ironing suit, so he decided to dress up as Tony Stark!</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174545" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kf9JXcHxbAcwCpdrNsRB.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="536" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kf9JXcHxbAcwCpdrNsRB.jpg 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kf9JXcHxbAcwCpdrNsRB-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/kf9JXcHxbAcwCpdrNsRB-768x402.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Needless to say, if you really have a living soul who has never seen a Marvel movie, Tony Stark is a beautifully portrayed Iron Man alter ego in Robert Downey Jr.&#8217;s movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>As you can see in the picture, Evan absolutely nailed his outfit.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174548" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HsItpeKdjYnloLQNocVe.png" alt="" width="1440" height="1083" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HsItpeKdjYnloLQNocVe.png 1440w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HsItpeKdjYnloLQNocVe-300x226.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HsItpeKdjYnloLQNocVe-1024x770.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HsItpeKdjYnloLQNocVe-768x578.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /></p>
<p>Evan has hair, a beard, and even a unique Tony Stark glass! If you look closely, you can see that he also has a label with the name of Stark Industries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>His mother, Jill, said he would only respond to &#8220;Tony&#8221; or &#8220;Mr. Stark&#8221; on the morning of his school party.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-174557" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Tony-Stark.gif" alt="" width="801" height="327" /></p>
<p>Evan also demanded that he be taken to school with his mother&#8217;s Mercedes, but due to schedule conflicts, Evan was forced to take a school bus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>About 20 minutes after Evan reached school, his mother got a call from the principal&#8217;s office and it was quite upsetting.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174558" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1bc67T4n4QjdwfDWP8v2.png" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1bc67T4n4QjdwfDWP8v2.png 640w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1bc67T4n4QjdwfDWP8v2-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty minutes after getting on the bus, Evan called me from school. Apparently, the kids on the same bus, who weren&#8217;t even wearing costumes, told him he looked stupid,&#8221; Jill mentioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>As soon as Evan arrived at school, he ran to wash his face and waited for his mother.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-174559" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Az3UVv4YBIjojieMQ3oS.png" alt="" width="1220" height="915" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Az3UVv4YBIjojieMQ3oS.png 2160w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Az3UVv4YBIjojieMQ3oS-300x225.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Az3UVv4YBIjojieMQ3oS-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Az3UVv4YBIjojieMQ3oS-768x576.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Az3UVv4YBIjojieMQ3oS-1536x1151.png 1536w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Az3UVv4YBIjojieMQ3oS-2048x1535.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1220px) 100vw, 1220px" /></p>
<p>“He kept saying that he and I worked so hard on it,&#8221; Jill told <a href="https://www.today.com/parents/boy-bullied-tony-stark-halloween-costume-goes-viral-t236332?cid=sm_npd_td_fb_pa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Today Parents</a>. “He really was concerned about how I would feel, which basically shows a lot about him.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Jill took Evan to the ice cream and Frappuccino outlet and that calmed him down.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174562" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/XSVdVaz9NwG9VYhULVZz.png" alt="" width="1440" height="1080" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/XSVdVaz9NwG9VYhULVZz.png 1440w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/XSVdVaz9NwG9VYhULVZz-300x225.png 300w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/XSVdVaz9NwG9VYhULVZz-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/XSVdVaz9NwG9VYhULVZz-768x576.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px" /></p>
<p>It took him some time, but after a while, Evan began to relax. Once he stopped crying and regained his composure, his mother asked him if he wanted to go back to school for the party.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Evan was worried at first, but in the style of a true superhero, decided to ignore his fears straight away!</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174563" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DlpVZZfkXzEYLRsmRu1R.png" alt="" width="768" height="577" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DlpVZZfkXzEYLRsmRu1R.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DlpVZZfkXzEYLRsmRu1R-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;So we had gone home to redo his wonderful makeup, and brought him back to school!&#8221; His mother mentioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Little Tony Stark was even able to ride his Mercedes as he wanted!</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174564" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dyvWR5OgcGCCP12HHk0T.png" alt="" width="768" height="577" srcset="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dyvWR5OgcGCCP12HHk0T.png 768w, https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/dyvWR5OgcGCCP12HHk0T-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></p>
<p>&#8220;He was a little afraid to be back to school,&#8221; Jill told Today Parents. &#8220;But he had an amazing day, and he was very proud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Jill said it was a defining moment for her son, a moment that he will be carrying with him forever.</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-174565" src="https://www.hiptoro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GHfh8gje7uX5aYxklrXQ.gif" alt="" width="738" height="452" /></p>
<p>Jill truly believes that if Evan didn&#8217;t go back to school, it would have broken his spirit.</p>
<p>His mother&#8217;s Facebook post has been shared hundreds of thousands of times since Evans&#8217; heroic story first became known. This is living proof that not all heroes wear masks.</p>
