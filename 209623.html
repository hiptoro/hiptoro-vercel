			<p>Let&#8217;s talk about cats, an animal that we all adore and have for centuries. They combine all the positive qualities into one. These animals are adorable, perceptive, compassionate, inquisitive, silly, and, of course, moody. They are extremely photogenic, or at least some of them are, which is the most important thing (when they want to be).</p>
<p>They are constantly moving, making it impossible to get a still photo of them. For maybe 3 to 4 seconds, you might be able to get their attention, but that&#8217;s about it. Forget about them remaining still from that point forward as soon as they notice something, even if it&#8217;s as small as a fly. You must be thinking that making a video would be the best course of action. Hold that thought, though, because we have the answer for you!</p>
<p>Cat behaviourist Ingrid Johnson asserts that if you photograph cats in their natural habitat, where they are most at ease, you can actually capture some excellent shots of them. She clarified in a conversation, “Taking cats out of their home for a photo shoot is often where things go awry. Use natural light and play with them to encourage them to look confident and alert.” So much for our idea to take our cat to the beach for a lovely photo shoot!</p>
<p>Continue reading Ingrid&#8217;s interview to see if we can find any advice that will be helpful. Don&#8217;t forget to take in some hilarious AF cat posts, of course!</p>

<p>There isn&#8217;t a better justification!</p>
<p>Ingrid also suggested the following additional tips for photographing your cat well:</p>
<p>“Also use toys to get them to look in the direction you want! You can shake treats, click, make some sort of sound to get them to look at the camera. As far as keeping them calm, again, it’s about working with what they are naturally giving you rather than trying to force something … The answer is highly variable based on the cat, how well socialized to people they are, their experiences and bond with their human(s), etc. For some cats, they cannot get enough, for others, they approach and engage on their terms. Most cats prefer to control the interactions. Playing ‘hard to get’ is going to welcome the cat to approach you for affection. Cats have little interest in the human that wants to pick them up and smoother them with affection.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>This cat should still be in a horror film despite how adorable it is!</h2>

<p>&#8230;by the cat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>She also discussed the need for humans to accept and value cats more for who they are as individuals. We shouldn&#8217;t expect them to be, and they most definitely won&#8217;t be, perfect pets.</p>
<p>Ingrid has also educated us on the importance of spending at least 20 minutes a day with your cat, regardless of breed. Additionally, keep an eye out for any signals your cat may give you if it is begging for attention. These behaviors could include trying to annoy you, jumping on your lap, following you around, or getting in your way while you&#8217;re trying to do something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
