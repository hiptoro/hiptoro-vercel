			<p>Just a few days before she turns 27, a cat in the United Kingdom was named the oldest cat in the world.</p>
<p>Guinness World Records gave the record to Flossie on Thursday. The cat has been alive for 26 years and 329 days, which is about the same as being 120 years old in human years.</p>
<p>Flossie has lived in many different places over the course of her long life. They found out about Flossie&#8217;s long life after getting her from the charity and adoption group Cats Protection, which is focused on the well-being of cats.</p>
<blockquote><p>We were flabbergasted when we saw that Flossie&#8217;s vet records showed her to be 27 years old,</p></blockquote>
<p>said Cats Protection&#8217;s Branch Co-ordinator Naomi Rosling.</p>

<p>A worker at the Merseyside hospital in Liverpool was the first person to adopt her. This happened in December 1995. She was a stray who lived near the hospital and wandered around with a group of strays. A few of the people who worked there decided to take one home. The cat lived with her new owner for the next ten years, until they died.</p>
<p>Then, her owner&#8217;s sister took her in and raised her for the next 14 years, until they passed away.</p>
<p>When she was 24, the son of the person who had owned her before took her in. She worked for him for about three years. He tried everything to help her, but he still had to take her to Cats Protection.</p>
<blockquote><p>It wasn&#8217;t an easy decision,</p></blockquote>
<p>said Naomi Rosling at Cats Protection.</p>
<blockquote><p>He sought our help when it was in Flossie&#8217;s best interests. Responsible cat ownership is when someone thinks about an animal&#8217;s needs above their feelings.</p></blockquote>
<h6></h6>
<p>Since older cats are less likely to be adopted, it seemed like Flossie would live out the rest of her life at Cats Protection. But Vicki Green, who had taken care of four older cats before, took her in soon after. Vicki had a cat that lived for 21 years.</p>

<blockquote><p>She was loud for the first few nights because she can&#8217;t see in the dark and was a bit confused in her new surroundings, but she sleeps through the night now, snuggled on the bed with me,</p></blockquote>
<p>Green said.</p>
<blockquote><p>She sometimes misses her litter box or needs help grooming herself, but I can help with all of that. We&#8217;re in this together,</p></blockquote>
<p>she said.</p>
<p>Green said that, even though Flossie can&#8217;t hear or see, she is still very playful. She is also in good health, and both being held and eating makes her happy.</p>
<blockquote><p>She never turns her nose up at the chance of a good meal,</p></blockquote>
<p>Green said.</p>
<blockquote><p>I knew from the start that Flossie was a special cat, but I didn&#8217;t imagine I&#8217;d share my home with a world record holder,</p></blockquote>
<p>she said.</p>

<p>Creme Puff was the oldest cat who ever lived. Flossie is the oldest cat in the world right now. Creme Puff lived in Texas until she died in 2005. She was 38 years and 3 days old when she died.</p>
<p>Gino, who is 22 years old, is the oldest dog in the world right now.</p>
<p>The average life span of a domestic cat, according to the Blue Cross, is about 15â€“20 years, but cats that have been neutered, tend to live even longer. When a cat is 15 years old, it is considered to be in its senior years.</p>
<p>According to Cat Care 4 Life, an organization in the United Kingdom that helps cat owners take care of their pets and find reputable clinics, a cat&#8217;s average lifespan is probably between 13 and 14 years.</p>
<p>The size of a dog&#8217;s breed affects how long it lives on average, with smaller dog breeds usually living longer than larger dog breeds. The average life span for small dog breeds, according to the American Kennel Club, is 10 to 15 years, but some can live up to 18 years. Some breeds of small dogs can live even longer than that. Medium-sized dog breeds live on average between 10 and 13 years, while large dog breeds live on average between 8 and 12 years.</p>
